  <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">On
  a grey winter day in 1975, I drove Olive to the Adelaide airport, and watched
  her small figure walk purposefully across the tarmac to the plane. The
  decision to travel to Vancouver was made without consultation, and she made
  all the travel arrangements herself. I have no idea what communication may
  have taken place with Trish and what knowledge Olive may have had of the
  family situation in Canada. It was 16 years since her last visit with Norman
  and, in the intervening time, the family unit had been torn apart by the
  breakdown of Bob and Trish’s marriage and the devastating effect this had on
  Trish and the children. <o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>She arrived at Vancouver airport after the long flight from Sydney via
  Honolulu - her first international flight. Over the recent years, there had
  been little exchange of photographs so neither Olive, nor Burk, Stacey and
  Steve who had come to meet her, could be sure of recognising each other.
  Stacey recalls that the flight seemed to be full of small grey-haired
  grandmothers. After several approaches that had failed to bear fruit, they
  stood irresolute in the reception area. Olive claims that she recognised Burk
  by some familiar family gesture and approached them enquiring, ‘Would you
  happen to be the Quintrell children?’ She tells how Burk drove around for
  what seemed to be a very long time – although the drive from Richmond to
  North Vancouver may simply have seemed long to her after 24 hours on the plane
  – trying to find the words to gently introduce her to the chaos that might
  greet her. She moved in with the family in the apartment in North Vancouver,
  sharing a Christmas with them, and a celebration of a year of sobriety for
  Trish.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>On the back of the photograph below, she has written ‘…my first
  visit alone, after fifteen years. Sue was born while we were [last] there,
  Steven born one year later. I had not known him or seen them in all that
  time.’ Whoever has arranged the photo has placed Olive at the centre of the
  group, her arm around Steve and her hand on Stacey’s shoulder. It is
  possible to read hints of awkwardness in the stance or expression of each of
  the others, but Olive looks to be completely at home. She found her way to the
  craft room in the basement of the apartment building and pursued her love of
  craft producing, as Stacey remembers, ‘amazingly intricate pictures on
  various ceramic articles, tiles, saucers and bowls. She also made crystal
  icicles and three of the surviving ones now hang on our Christmas tree each
  year, a reminder of Grannie and her visits.’ She brought back to Australia
  various examples of her craft, including a plaster casting of seagulls
  hovering above wharf pylons that she presented to Charmian and me. We can now
  admit that it had little appeal for us, but we had to find some place for it
  for years! ‘She was never bored,’ writes Stacey, ‘ and always seemed to
  be doing something – cooking, crafting, writing letters …’ <o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">It
  appears that the Canadian grandchildren found her presence reassuring and she
  had the ability to surprise them with an unexpected gift of acceptance. One
  evening, Trish rang from work. She had forgotten her glasses and wanted Stacey
  to bring them to her. The Nursing Home where Trish was working was half a mile
  away and the path to it was poorly lit. Stacey must have shown some evidence
  of discomfort about having to make the walk alone in the dark, so Olive
  offered to go with her. <o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">‘Just
  knowing that she would be willing to walk on that path in the dark was enough
  to reassure me I could do it,’ says Stacey. <o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">On
  another occasion, Sue brought home a new boyfriend. ‘My boyfriend of 2
  years, a very handsome, blond, blue-eyed, bright,
  “All-American’-looking” boy, wanted me back (after having dumped me for
  a large-breasted woman in his grade!),’ she remembers, ‘and I had just
  begun dating a boy … who looked similar to a tall Manson look-alike – dark
  hair below his shoulders, cowboy boots, goatee beard … He came to the
  apartment, settled himself in a chair, and put his cowboy boot-encased legs up
  on the table. All my friends and siblings had been giving me hell over my
  latest choice asking what I thought I was doing. So, I’m standing in the
  apartment, looking down at Grannie, expecting a similar serve. What she
  actually said I can’t now recall, but I know I was bracing myself for total
  disapproval and her response was nothing like I expected. Oh, it was clear
  that putting your feet on the furniture was not right, but the anticipated
  disapproving response wasn’t there. I remember thinking “I really like
  this Grannie person. She’s cool!” After Dad left, we were fed a consistent
  line that nothing good could come out of Australia, but this was my first
  direct experience that maybe Mum’s view of the world might be a bit skewed.
  When I got older, I began to appreciate what Grannie really meant to us. In a
  world where it seemed that adults were walking out on us, Grannie was walking
  in and, for many years, she was the only positive connection I had with my
  Dad’s side of the family.’<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Stacey
  echoes this last sentiment and notes that ‘Grannie’s constant presence
  was, for me, a reminder that we were connected to another family.’<o:p>

  1975 visit was the first of others to Vancouver and time has blurred these
  visits together, but there are some constant themes. Sue and Stacey, who had
  to share a bedroom with Olive at times, remember her famous stertorous
  snoring! Frai and Lorene, who also travelled with Olive to visit Bob in
  Wollongong in the 1970s, agree! Steve fondly remembers Grannie’s famous
  pasties and her ‘bubble-and-squeak’<a title style="mso-footnote-id: ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span style="mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[1]</span></a>.

  of the details of the time she spent in Vancouver in 1975 are now largely
  forgotten and are, in the final analysis, irrelevant. What is important about
  that visit is that it paved the way for visits to Australia by Burk and Stacey
  over the next few years, the return of Bob to Vancouver in 1979, and the
  ongoing links between her grandchildren and great-grandchildren that have
  continued to this day.<o:p>

  <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Olive
  returned from her 1975 Canadian trip, carrying herself with calm resolve. With
  little reference to anyone, she sold the Toorak Gardens unit and purchased a
  unit on a lovely creek setting just across the road from their old Hawthorn
  house. With some help from us she stripped off old wallpaper and added new,
  repainted the kitchen, revived the garden on the creek bank and put her stamp
  on her new home. She was now in her seventies and beginning to show some signs
  of aging. Her arthritis nagged at her constantly, but she was never heard to
  complain. <o:p>

  </span>In 1977, she returned to Vancouver again. She was adventurous enough to
  travel alone by Greyhound bus down the west coast of the United States. And to
  go flying with Burk. <o:p>

  </span>On a cool autumn day in 1977, Burk and Olive drove east out to Pitt
  Meadows airport, at the junction of the Fraser and Pitt Rivers, Olive, as
  ever, dressed smartly and sensibly. Had she ever flown in a small plane
  before? I doubt it. But the same spirit that had allowed her to be locked in a
  box for her brother to ‘saw her in half’ was still there and she boarded
  the plane and took off with Burk, flying up the Fraser Valley before turning
  north up Howe Sound and over the stunningly spectacular Coast Range. The
  slides she took of that journey have disappeared long ago but I know at first
  hand how beautiful that flight would have been as, only six years later, we
  took the same flight with Burk. It remains vividly in our memory as one of our
  peak holiday experiences. Pitt Meadows has another connection. In the sixties,
  Bob had taken flying lessons there and had completed his pilot’s license.<o:p>

  was also prepared to venture out on the waters of the Georgia strait. On one
  of her visits, she boarded Burk’s launch the ‘Marauder’ at Horseshoe Bay
  for the long trip to Quadra Island and beyond. They traced the ferry route
  towards Nanaimo on Vancouver Island and, on passing Bowen island, turned
  north. They covered about 60 km. on the first day and moored overnight at
  Secret Cove on the Sechelt Peninsula. The next day was a longer reach –
  about 100 km - to Quathiaski Cove on Quadra Island, where they met Steve who
  joined them for the next stage of the journey. It is easy for me to envisage
  the next part of the trip as Charmian, Frai and I retraced the route during
  our 1990 visit. They sailed north up Discovery Passage, timing their trip to
  arrive at Seymour Narrows just at the turn of the tide, easing through to the
  northern end of Quadra Island. Manoeuvring their way through the eddies and
  whirlpools of Okisollo Channel and Hole in the Wall, they anchored for the
  night at Harbott Point on Stuart island. The next day, turning south they
  sailed through Pryce and Waddington Channels to Melanie Cove in Desolation
  Sound Marine Park. Her legendary good humour would have been fully tested by
  the ‘head’ that, on the Marauder, was a good three feet below deck level.
  For the diminutive and rather modest Olive, already struggling with arthritis,
  necessary visits would have been challenging. Nevertheless, what her Canadian
  grandchildren recall is her laughter at having to be lowered in and lifted
  out! I can imagine Olive spending quite a bit of time below deck, taking
  charge of the galley and making endless rounds of sandwiches and cups of tea.<o:p>

  Desolation Sound, they made the journey back to Quadra to drop Steve off.
  Olive’s tracing on the map shows a return visit to Desolation Sound, with
  overnight anchorages at Refuge Cove and Squirrel Cove. At Refuge Cove she
  would have been relieved of kitchen duties as the crew demanded the hamburgers
  for which the Cove shop is famous. Leaving Desolation Sound, they turned south
  again for Vancouver, travelling via the Malaspina Channel and Jervois Inlet to
  an overnight stay at Secret Bay. After an overnight at Secret Cove, they
  returned to Horseshoe Bay.<o:p>

  <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Although
  Olive was seldom openly disapproving of her Canadian family, she had subtle
  ways of indicating that perhaps things could be done differently. Stacey
  remembers that, whenever Olive came to stay with them, she never commented on
  the fact that Rod was expected to prepare his share of meals, but quietly took
  over whenever it was his turn to cook. She had enough tact not to venture into
  Kirstie or Fergus’ bedrooms, but was puzzled (if not openly disapproving) by
  the idea of having children’s rooms in the basement of a house. Olive is
  credited with introducing the idea of ice-cream cakes, supplying one for
  Fergus’ second birthday. ‘To this day,’ says Stacey, ‘ I can never
  taste ice-cream cake without thinking of Grannie.’<o:p>

  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">‘She
  was always dressed beautifully,’ Stacey continues. ‘Even when we went for
  a picnic at Eagle Harbour Beach, she was dressed up! She taught us all the
  names of the flowers in our yard and told us that she had Lily of the Valley
  in her wedding bouquet. I have always planted Lily of the Valley since then
  and its fragrance reminds me of Grannie.’ <o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">All
  of her Canadian grandchildren associate one key feature about Olive. ‘She
  laughed a lot,’ say both Stacey and Sue. ‘We don’t ever remember a sad
  time when Grannie was around.’ <o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">In
  1977, Stacey made what was to be a significant visit to Australia, meeting up
  with her father for the first time since he had left Canada, and putting in
  place the last, necessary span of the Canada-Australia bridge. Although she
  never spoke of it, Stacey’s visit must have validated Olive’s visits. Soon
  after, Burk made a flying visit, and the connection was sealed.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">In
  1979, Bob made the decision to return to Canada. He was divorced for the
  second time, had lost his job at the Illawarra Mercury, and was just out of
  rehab for alcoholism. Twenty years had passed since Olive and Norman left
  Sydney for their first visit to Canada and had walked on a beach in Spain,
  contented with their life, having completed the years of parenting. Now, a
  second parenting task was coming to fruition. She had built the bridge that
  allowed her son to venture back to Canada and made it possible for a task of
  reconciliation to begin. She could now only watch and hope for what might be.<o:p>
