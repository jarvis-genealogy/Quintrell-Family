  THE OVERSEAS TRIP<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span></b></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2"><font face="Arial">International travel has become a
  commonplace thing, but in the Fifties it was still a major expedition for
  Australian travellers. Norman’s firm was generous with holiday leave and
  with payment during their absence and this enabled Olive and Norman to extend
  their travels well beyond the planned visit to Vancouver.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><font face="Arial">They left
  Adelaide on the evening ‘Overland’ train for Melbourne on 29<sup>th</sup>
  May, 1959 where they spent a couple of days that included seeing ‘My Fair
  Lady’ on stage. Travelling on to Sydney on ‘The Spirit of Progress’,
  they met friends, saw the sights, and went to the stage version of ‘South
  Pacific’. On 10<sup>th</sup> June, they left from Sydney on the SS ‘Orcades’,
  sailing by way of New Zealand, Suva, Fiji, and Honolulu, arriving in Vancouver
  on June 25<sup>th</sup>.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><font face="Arial">It is
  obvious that they were having a wonderful time and Olive’s diary is full of
  detail about the food they ate, the games they played on board the ship, and
  the sights they saw at each stopping place: she reports what flowers grew,
  which hotels they visited and so on. ‘Still eating like horses and sleeping
  like logs!’ she reports as they left Suva. At another time she notes that,
  after some games, ‘The deck was cleared; the bars were opened; champagne
  turned on; (we had a) buffet supper; dancing; to bed after midnight.’<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>After they had crossed the equator, she records an evening when they
  ‘watched a movie (‘Gigi’) at night in the open air under a tropical
  moon.’ This note is followed by the comment ‘Woo Woo!’ to which the
  reader may place his or her own interpretation! She details the costumes worn
  by people at the fancy dress party and comments again on the ‘warm night,
  carnival atmosphere [and] to bed after midnight’. A few days out from
  Vancouver, she writes, ‘We’ll have to get off this boat for a rest!’.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><font face="Arial">As they
  approached the coast of the USA, misty rain began to fall and thick fog rolled
  in. Two days out of Vancouver, the fog was thicker, and the ship was making
  slow progress. She writes that she ‘thought our number was up.’ However,
  the next day the fog cleared and in cold, misty rain they sailed towards
  Canada, the snow-capped mountains of the Olympic Range to starboard and
  Vancouver Island to port. Using his CBC connections, Bob came aboard and took
  them ashore before they had to clear customs. The Vancouver they saw in 1959
  was a very different one from that of 2004. The north shore was largely
  unpopulated, and the city itself had few of the high-rise buildings that now
  crowd the shoreline.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><font face="Arial">For the
  next ten weeks, she reports the usual tourist activities: visits to Queen
  Elizabeth Park and Cleveland Dam; ferry to Nanaimo and a stay in Victoria; and
  drives to Stanley Park, to Mount Seymour, and up the Fraser Valley. There was
  cricket at Brockton Point<a title style="mso-footnote-id: ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span style="mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[1]</span></a>
  (including a visit from the MCC), and Norman umpired some of the local
  matches.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><font face="Arial">An
  important event rates only a single line. ‘Wednesday, August 12<sup>th</sup>:
  Fine. Home all day. Susan Leslie (6lb 10 oz) born’.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Olive’s Canadian grandchildren may be amused by her description of
  them in a letter to Neil on 23<sup>rd</sup> August 1959.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt"><i><font face="Arial">‘Susan
  Leslie<a title style="mso-footnote-id: ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><span style="mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[2]</span></a>
  is a dear. She has a mop of black hair (looks curly) … and has a little
  round face, small mouth and turned up nose like Trish, and yet looks like no
  one in particular and is, so far, very good. Burk is certainly like a 6 year
  old, terribly serious … and carries the world and its worries on his
  shoulders … Stacey is quite a trick and smart, although doesn’t speak
  particularly well yet.’<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></i><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><font face="Arial">In late
  August, Olive and Norman made a brief visit to Seattle and then, on September
  14<sup>th</sup> took a trip on the Pacific Coast Railway to Lake Louise and
  Banff. Returning to Vancouver, they packed, farewelled Bob and Trish, and left
  on a Greyhound journey through the United States. Olive reports reams of
  numbers – the cost of houses, the length of bridges and roadways, the
  numbers of commuters and motels, and so on. Throughout her whole diary, I get
  the impression of someone seeing the larger world for the first time and
  marvelling at its size and complexity. Her accounts are peppered with words
  and phrases like ‘glorious’, ‘magnificent’, fabulous’,
  ‘colossal’, ‘impressive’, and ‘an absolute eye-opener’. She and
  Norman laughed at a dry cleaners’ ad that invited people to ‘drop your
  clothes off here’.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><font face="Arial">They paid
  $1.25 each to enter Disneyland and, like most people, found it ‘an absolute
  fairyland’. They crammed all the tourist highlights into three days –
  Disneyland, Knots Berry Farm, Forest Lawn cemetery, Beverley Hills, and
  Hollywood (which in the more innocent parlance, of the time, but perhaps
  prophetically, Olive described as ‘large and gay’!). At Las Vegas, Norman
  won $20 and Olive $3 on the slot machines. Olive continues to wax lyrical and
  in one paragraph she uses ‘fabulous’ three times, as well as
  ‘tremendous’, ‘glorious’, ‘terrific’ and wonderful’, and
  describes herself as ‘absolutely amazed’. They travelled on through Utah,
  Wyoming and Nebraska, and by this time are beginning to be overwhelmed by
  their new experiences. Olive hankers for something familiar.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><font face="Arial">‘We’re
  sick of the thought of …hamburgers, coffee, iced water …(and) …hot beef
  sandwiches; and the idea of a loin of lamb, roast potatoes (and) green peas
  … makes our mouth water.’</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><font face="Arial">In
  Chicago, Norman attended a conference of architects and joiners. While Norman
  was conferencing, Olive was asked to talk to the conference wives about
  Australia and her impressions of America. Unfortunately, she does not provide
  any details of her experience. After the conference, they continued on their
  Greyhound bus tour, travelling through Michigan and Indiana. Olive has a
  cryptic comment in one entry where she reports that ‘the talk on the bus
  about children and school would shock anyone’, but she provides no details
  of her concerns. She again shows some tiredness for travel when passing a
  tunnel across to Canada. ‘At this stage,’ she writes, ‘we were wishing
  we could go through the tunnel back to Bob, Trish and the children’.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>The next day, they did drive through the tunnel into Ontario and to
  Niagara Falls. On 20<sup>th</sup> October, which she notes as ‘Bob’s
  birthday and our 31<sup>st</sup> anniversary’, they met Trish’s parents
  who took them on a tourist drive. Then they crossed back into the US and drove
  into New York State, marvelling at the ‘miles and miles of glorious autumn
  colours’. As on a number of other occasions, Olive observes the cultural mix
  on the buses – ‘Americans, West Indians, Indians, Negroes, Southerners and
  <u>only two Australians</u><a title style="mso-footnote-id: ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><span style="mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[3]</span></a>’.
  By now the travellers are becoming a little jaded and Olive describes her
  entry into New York as ‘… so far not impressed. Too busy and too large!’
  A good night’s sleep seems to have momentarily restored their energies and
  next day found them back at their cracking pace. On Sunday, they visited the
  statue of Liberty, Times Square, Harlem, Spanish Harlem, the Rockefeller
  Centre, the United Nations, Greenwich Village, and saw New York by night from
  the top of the Empire state building. However, the following day found Olive
  again disoriented.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt"><i><font face="Arial">‘It’s
  just a madhouse, letting the rest of the world go by and just bashing their
  heads against stone walls. The city is so modern and busy that it is reverting
  to yesteryear ideas. (There is) … no room for merchandise to be unloaded in
  the main streets (and) no parking room, so darkies push little trollies for
  hours up and down, laden with goods. Sirens, hooters, subway railways, planes,
  cars, lorries, whistles and anything that can make a noise does so<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>… everything goes like crazy. Men from the Bowery line up for
  rations, people beg, everyone drives big cars, always on the brake. … Lots
  of assistants rude and discourteous.’<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></i><font face="Arial"><o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><font face="Arial">That
  night they went to bed ‘leg weary and tired’. The next day they packed and
  took their cases out to the Queen Mary, ready for their trip to England. They
  felt that they were handled rudely as they checked out from their hotel and
  Olive continues to complain that ‘everything is loud, noisy and fast’.
  Anyone who has travelled can recognise that they are in ‘culture shock’
  and badly need a break. Fortunately, they were about to get it. They boarded
  the Queen Mary and one can hear Olive’s sigh of relief: ‘Glad to hear
  English (British) spoken and to feel at home.’ Their spirits may also have
  been lifted by news from Australia of the birth of Chalien Floy. The
  travellers, now back in more familiar surroundings, went to bed and ‘slept
  well’.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><font face="Arial">The
  crossing was apparently uneventful and Olive took the chance to regroup, going
  to on-board movies, walking the deck, taking afternoon naps, and going to bed
  early. In the photo of them on the Queen Mary Olive is holding a doll dressed
  as a seaman. She brought this back to Australia for her new granddaughter and,
  forty-five years later, it still resides in our toy box for our grandchildren.
  He has had to have some minor surgery – one arm has gone missing and has
  been replaced by Charmian – but Olives’ great-great-grandchildren still
  play with it.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></span><font face="Arial">On
  the fifth day of the crossing the ship docked at Cherbourg, France and the
  passengers were able to have a few hours ashore before sailing on to
  Southampton. On a dull morning with misty rain, they breakfasted early,
  disembarked, and caught the train for London, Olive grumbling about what she
  saw as an excessive extra charge – sixteen shillings and sixpence.<a title style="mso-footnote-id: ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><span style="mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[4]</span></a>
  Their taxi from Waterloo station took them past Westminster, Buckingham
  Palace, Hyde Park and Marble Arch to a very ‘olde worlde’ hotel.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><font face="Arial">Their
  energies renewed after the slower pace of the Atlantic crossing, they threw
  themselves into sightseeing with enthusiasm, despite days of rain and fog.
  Apart from the traditional tourist sights, they took in some theatre –
  ‘Five Pennies’ with Danny Kaye and ‘A taste of honey’, Olive betraying
  her relatively conservative attitudes by noting that the latter was ‘modern,
  down-to-earth and hides nothing’.</font></p>

  <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align="center"><i><font face="Arial">Olive
  and Norman aboard the ‘Queen Mary’, November 1959.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></i></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><font face="Arial">The age
  of England obviously had an impact on Olive. They visited many historical
  sites – Runnymede, Hampton Court, the old London Wall, St Pauls, the Tower
  of London, Dickens’ house – her list goes on and on. Her recording of
  events in America had become shorter and shorter as the trip progressed but
  now the excitement of discovery was back and she records, in meticulous
  detail, places, dates and impressions, noting that London is ‘oozing with
  history’. The scars of the War were still obvious. ‘St Paul’s stands in
  the centre of a greatly bombed area’, she notes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Forty years later, when Charmian and I stood in the same place, new
  buildings had transformed the area.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><font face="Arial">On
  November 15<sup>th</sup>, they boarded the ‘Princess Margaret’ for the
  Channel crossing to Calais, watching the famed White Cliffs of Dover retreat
  as they left England. From Calais, they caught the train to Paris, Olive again
  noting the presence of many other-cultural travellers – ‘dark people,
  Irish, English, Americans, French, one New Zealander and <u>only three
  Australians</u><a title style="mso-footnote-id: ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"><span style="mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[5]</span></a>’.
  The next day they toured the sights of Paris, including the famous Montmartre
  cemetery. Olive was unimpressed. ‘The oldest (and deadest!) cemetery ever,
  preserved only for family vaults (ghastly!)’. After a visit to the Eiffel
  Tower, they caught the Metro home arriving at about 6 pm. To Olive’s
  distaste they had to ‘battle our way along the street through “women”
  – just ghastly and repulsive, but then, this is Paris!’ Her eyes are
  opened even wider on a visit to the Palace of Fontainebleau. ‘There seems to
  be walls everywhere,’ she writes, ‘and it seems that when men see them
  they say, “Let’s face it, chaps” – and they do – regardless – but
  then <u>this is Paris!</u>’ Olive’s report on their visit to Versailles
  veer between marvelling at the opulence of the palace and again being
  astounded to find toilets being shared by both men and women.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><font face="Arial">On 23<sup>rd</sup>
  November, they boarded the train at Gare d’Austerlitz for an overnight ride
  to Spain. They joined a French and Spanish traveller in their eight-person
  apartment and slept fitfully until about 4 am, when a Spanish family of four
  crowded into the carriage. The family unloaded bread, garlic sausage and wine
  and offered them around. Olive and Norman found the idea of wine at 4 am
  somewhat daunting, and refused politely! Later, in the dining car, they were
  offered a selection of wines. Having no Spanish, Olive simply pointed at one
  bottle that, to their disappointment, turned out to be mineral water!</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><font face="Arial">It is
  clear that their spirits had revived. They had been given a balcony room at
  their hotel in Barcelona and Norman suggested that he get a guitar and
  serenade her from the street; but as the balcony was four stories up, decided
  against it! They were impressed with Barcelona and Olive is again using
  superlatives to describe their responses – ‘absolutely magnificent’,
  ‘spectacular’, ‘amazing’ etc. They seem to have taken in every
  possible tourist sight: the (still) unfinished Gaudi Cathedral, the
  artisans’ quarter (glass-blowers, potters, painters, weavers etc), the views
  of the city from Mount Tibidabo, the shops and arcades, the illuminated
  fountain (which particularly entranced her), and folk dancing in the square.
  They even went night-clubbing at the “Rio” and the “Bolero”, arriving
  back at their hotel at 3.30 am. They settled into the rhythm of Spain and she
  reports mealtimes – breakfast at 10.30 am, lunch at 3 pm and dinner at 8.30
  pm.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><font face="Arial">They
  attended the last bullfight of the season, and Olive was not going to miss out
  on any experience. She writes</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt"><i><font face="Arial">‘[It
  was] very colourful and exciting, but gory, and we are thrilled to think that
  we saw one. … It is very spectacular and lively … The matadors (picadors,
  toreadors, whatever) come in (after visiting the Cathedral) with cloaks, and
  then the bull. The sparring and teasing goes on for a while, and then they use
  small spears and pierce the back, and then the kill, great shouting and
  clapping … and coats, hats, bouquets, cushions, anything is thrown down and
  the hero is obliged to toss them back – Norman nearly threw me down! – and
  [the matador] is given the ear of the bull. After the third kill, Norman asked
  if I’d like to go out as I looked white, but not likely. We’d paid our 50
  pesetas<a title style="mso-footnote-id: ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"><span style="mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[6]</span></a>
  each, so I wanted my money’s worth. It was really another leaf in our book
  of experience – but that’s it.’<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></i><font face="Arial"><o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><font face="Arial">The next
  day they went to the monastery at Mount Monsarrat, adding what has become a
  regular theme throughout the diary that they were ‘the only two
  Australians’ on the tour. I have the feeling that, far from this being an
  alienating experience, it is a matter of pride. They seem to be feeling bold
  and adventurous; far from home, experiencing new and exciting things, and
  showing that Australians have a rightful place in the world.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </font></span><font face="Arial">At a visit to a Mediterranean resort town 60
  miles from Barcelona they ‘walked along the foreshore in this lovely
  “sunny Spain”’ and sat and ate their lunch on the beach. Olive reports
  that ‘after seeing all the castles, palaces, churches, chapels and all, I
  feel about 20 years younger’. It’s as if the memory of the tension of the
  war years has dropped away, and she is a young woman in her 30s again, full of
  energies and possibilities.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </font></span><font face="Arial">After 12 days in Spain, they were on the
  train again for France. At the border she watched in amazement as ‘the other
  passengers piled in with bags, cases, baskets, babies and loaves of bread –
  packages put through the windows. The whole of Spain seemed to come in through
  the windows. It’s an education and a half. No one puts luggage in the vans,
  everything comes into the carriage and it’s every man for himself. We had a
  reasonable night – 2 Catalonians, 4 French and <u>two Australians.</u>
  Arrived in Paris at 8.30 am.’</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </font></span><font face="Arial">Departing Paris for Calais, they passed
  through the battlefields and the cemeteries of the First World War. One of the
  passengers, who had fought in the War, provided a commentary for them<a title style="mso-footnote-id: ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"><span style="mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[7]</span></a>.
  Olive writes that</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt"><i><font face="Arial">‘It
  makes one feel very glad to realise that we are so fortunate in Australia. I
  never imagined I’d be going over this ground and the places I had heard my
  Dad speak of; and the few phrases he used to say in French I would be using
  here myself and being understood.’<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></i><font face="Arial"><o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><font face="Arial">After a
  rough crossing to Dover, they were back in familiar territory. They returned
  to London a few weeks before Christmas, and marvelled at the decorations and
  lights. ‘Regent street is just a dream … every shop has wonderful
  illuminations and window displays. We still think London is way ahead in
  neatness, quality, shops and price.’ However, the weather was miserable. Fog
  and rain thwarted their attempts to photograph Westminster and other
  landmarks. It was ‘cold and dark by 3 pm and pitch black by 4 pm’ and they
  hankered for the long summer twilights of Vancouver. They called at the Post
  Office to receive letters and cards and were reminded how they had been
  cocooned in their travels and spared everyday occurrences. ‘A big mixture of
  ills and ails, accidents and deaths. Some Christmas cards. Quite confusing,
  but good to hear all the news.’<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><font face="Arial">On
  December 16<sup>th</sup>, they sailed from Tilbury on the ‘Iberia’ for
  their return home. Through the first week as they sailed through the
  Mediterranean, they experienced the familiar let-down at the end of travels
  and each day Olive notes their tiredness and lack of interest in shipboard
  events. This is such a contrast to their voyage 6 months earlier, when
  everything was new and exciting and they were seldom in bed before midnight.
  However, by Christmas Eve, they were through the Suez Canal, the weather had
  improved, and they were again in party mood, and ‘music, dancing and
  entertainment until midnight was enjoyed with a glorious night.’ On
  Christmas Day, they are in better spirits. ‘Lovely day, cool sea breezes,
  everyone friendly, some lonely and a little homesick.’</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><font face="Arial">At
  Colombo, as at Aden, Olive was confronted by the poverty of the people. ‘The
  odour on the wharves was enough to knock you over …the bus took us along one
  the dirtiest streets we have been in … crowded with natives young and old,
  crippled and blind beggars, <u>absolutely unbelievable</u> … children
  begging everywhere and everyone trying to sell anything and everything,
  absolutely crowded and noisy.’ Despite her misgivings, they still absorbed
  new experiences, riding in rickshaws, watching a roadside snake charmer, and
  soaking up the atmosphere.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><font face="Arial">On
  January 9<sup>th</sup>, they were back on Australian soil, sailing into
  Fremantle in the early morning. They had booked on a tour of Perth and Olive
  reports that they ‘felt very overjoyed and could have wept with pride on
  arrival.’ On January 13<sup>th</sup>, 7 months after they had departed, they
  were back at Port Adelaide. A crowd of friends was there to meet them and
  Olive notes that<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt"><i><font face="Arial">‘our
  biggest and most exciting thrill was to meet Charmie, Neil and our new little
  grand-daughter … they belong to us and we can see lots of them now we are
  home. [I am] “Cinderella returning from the ball” feeling a little like
  “Alice in Wonderland”.’<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></i><font face="Arial"><o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><font face="Arial">As they
  had walked the London streets, she had reflected on their experiences. ‘We
  never went hungry or got lost, and there were always actions by hands that
  helped a lot and now, it’s rather nice to walk along Regent and Oxford
  streets and feel happy that we are what we are…’. Travel had worked its
  magic for them, showing them a world beyond the borders of their experience
  and imagination while affirming their rightful place in the world. They ended
  the Fifties feeling contented and fulfilled.</font></p>
