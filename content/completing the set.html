  On an early February evening in 1959, I drove into my parents’ driveway,
  switched off the motor and sat for a time trying to compose the words for the
  news I had to break to them. I wondered if they had noticed the level of
  tension I had been carrying for the last few weeks as Charmian and I waited
  first for the overdue period and then for the doctor’s verdict. Now, the
  pregnancy confirmed, Charmian’s parents told and our decision to marry made,
  I had to tell my parents. I knew that they would be disappointed on at least
  two accounts. The decision to marry would mean that my plans to accompany them
  on their trip to my brother and his family in Canada would have to be
  abandoned. More than that, I would have significantly blotted my copybook in
  my mother’s estimation. <o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>‘You were the golden boy,’ my cousin Miriam told me many years
  later as we recalled the time. ‘Your Mum was so proud of you. Head prefect
  at school. Star student. University graduate. In her eyes, you could do no
  wrong. But boy, did she let the family know that you had let the side down
  over this!’<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>I sat in the car that night, trying to focus my attention on the task
  before me, experiencing a jumble of emotions. ‘Shame’ is too strong a
  word, but certainly embarrassment at, in the parlance of the time, ‘having
  to get married’. Some sadness, because I knew that I would be causing my
  parents both disappointment and trouble. Excitement tinged with apprehension
  at the prospect of having to set up home and become the provider for a family.
  But the dominant emotion was that strange and foolish pride men feel at having
  a woman carry ‘their’ child. <o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>I took a deep breath and walked into the house. I paused at my
  parents’ bedroom and knocked timidly. <o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:36.0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial">‘You
  awake?’ I asked softly, half hoping that there would be no response and I
  could avoid the confrontation until the next day. But my mother was still
  awake.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:36.0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial">‘Can
  I talk to you?’ I asked, entering and sitting on the end of the bed. My
  father stirred into wakefulness. The words I had rehearsed flowed out easily
  enough. Charmian was pregnant. We were in love. We wanted to marry as soon as
  possible.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:36.0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial">My
  mother’s response was as I expected. The descending cadence of the ‘Oh
  Neil’ betrayed her feelings. My father murmured something placating. I
  suppose we talked of possible arrangements, but all I remember is the tone of
  disappointment.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:36.0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial">To
  their credit, they never expressed this to Charmian and threw themselves with
  typical vigour into arrangements for the wedding. Dizzy with love and the
  expectation of marriage, driven by the need to establish regular employment
  and housing, preferably at a reasonable distance from the immediate scrutiny
  of others, I was blissfully unaware of my parents’ needs. They were, as
  ever, generous and diplomatic – except, as Miriam says, of Mum’s
  conversations with her sisters and brothers!<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span>
</div>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:36.0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial">So
we married and, in the way of the time, carried for some years the stigma of a
‘shotgun’ marriage until maturity and the blessedly more open attitudes of
today, released us.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 36.0pt" align="center">******************************************</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:36.0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial">The
establishing of a career and the pleasurable demands of home and family leave
little time for reflections on one’s ancestry. This has only begun over the
last decade as I have begun to think about the ways our forebears lived and to
gather together the strands that make up the weave of our history. The first
clue to a possible family trait came in the list of my Quintrell relatives
provided by my third cousin Greg’s wife, Gladys Grigg. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<div class="Section1">
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>The brides of my great-great-great grandfather Richard Quintrell, my
  great-great grandfather John Quintrell, my great-grandfather Stephen Quintrell
  and my grandfather Stephen William Quintrell were all pregnant on their
  wedding days. <o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>‘Well,’ I thought. ‘Dad could have done more than murmur
  platitudes when I came up with the news! I know we weren’t as close as
  either of us would have liked, but it seems that it wouldn’t have been too
  hard for him to take me aside and say, “Don’t worry, son. There’s a lot
  of it in our family!’<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>Not long after, putting together my mother’s family tree, I noticed
  that her mother Lily was married at the age of 16 years and five months and
  gave birth to her first child the day after the wedding. My grandfather Fred
  Scott was only 20 at the time and may have escaped some unpleasant legal
  proceedings relating to under-age sex by marrying Lily.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>‘Well, there you are,’ I thought. Maybe it’s in the genes!’<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>But wait, there’s more.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>Just a couple of months ago, in conversation with one of Charmian’s
  cousins, we discovered that Bert Brown and Tilly Atkins, Charmian’s
  mother’s parents were also well under way with their first child on their
  wedding day.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>‘I wish Mum was here now,’ Charmian laughed. ‘I’d like to have
  a word in her ear about her response to my situation!’<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>‘All we need now,’ I said jokingly, ‘is to find that your Wilson
  grandparents were similarly compromised and then we’d have a complete set of
  grandparents pregnant at the altar.’<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>So the next week, in the Public Library, we got out the records and
  traced the dates of the wedding of Eusebius Wilson (28 years) to Caroline
  Lemaistre (26 years) at the Baptist Manse in Adelaide on the 26<sup>th</sup>
  August 1898. Avice Clare was born on 5<sup>th</sup> December 1898.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>So, here’s to our four sets of grandparents - Fred and Lily, Steve
  and Edie, Bert and Tilly, and Eusebius and Caroline. We’ve completed the
  set. And don’t we wish our parents were here to sock it to them!&nbsp;</span></p>
