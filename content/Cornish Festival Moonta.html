  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-US" style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal"><font face="Arial">We left Adelaide on a grey May morning en route for the biennial Kerweneek
  Lowender Festival that celebrates the state’s Cornish heritage. We drove
  through intermittent rain, leaving the outer suburbs of Adelaide behind and
  entering the market gardens and flat, dry farmlands to the north of the city.
  At the head of St Vincent Gulf we turned westwards to the quiet country towns
  of the ‘Copper Triangle’ - Kadina, Wallaroo and Moonta. My Quintrell
  ancestors had arrived in Adelaide in 1858, Cornish miners drawn by the copper
  finds in the mid-north of the new, 22 year-old colony of South Australia. In
  the last half of the century Moonta, and its satellite Moonta Mines, was the
  largest country settlement in South Australia. Now, with the mines merely a
  small heritage community attached to a small coastal town, Moonta is a
  pleasant place to wile away some nostalgic hours. <o:p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-US" style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal"><font face="Arial">At
  an earlier visit, Liz, a member of the local National Trust, had offered us a
  conducted tour of the cemetery, now a National Trust memorial to the early
  settlers. The headstones are sprinkled with the names of my
  great-grandparents, great aunts, and distant relatives. In June 1897, when
  responsibility for the upkeep of cemeteries passed from a central to local
  authority, my great-grandfather <a href="Stephen%20W%20Quintrell.html"> Stephen Quintrell</a> was responsible for the
  formal surveying of the cemetery.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-US" style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal"><font face="Arial">Cemeteries
  are interesting places, carrying the social history of a place in unexpected
  ways. As one enters through the old iron gate in the high stone wall, there is
  a row of small unmarked mounds – the bodies of children who died of typhoid
  and diphtheria, courtesy of polluted ground water, in various epidemics. In
  one corner of the cemetery is the ‘Jewish section’ – the remains of just
  one Moonta family interred there - and there is one row reserved for
  Catholics, a reminder of the predominance of Methodism – Primitives, Bible
  Christians and Wesleyans – in the Cornish community. <o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-US" style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal"><font face="Arial">Liz
  gave us a vivid description of a typical funeral procession. The cemetery is 3
  miles from the mines and the pallbearers would lead, carrying the coffin. They
  would be followed by the mourners and the choir, singing the deceased’s
  favourite hymns. Everyone would be dressed in black. After 1898, the cemetery
  bell, cast from local copper, would have announced the arrival of the
  procession. The minister’s fervent prayers for the family of the deceased,
  enjoining them to believe that their loved one was now rejoicing in heaven
  with God and His angels, would have been punctuated with murmurs of ‘Amen’
  and “Praise the Lord’. <o:p>

  gravestone of Bessie, the wife of Johnson Quintrell, an uncle of my
  grandfather's. Bessie died, aged 25 years, after the death of three babies
  within less than three years, none of them reaching six months of age. Died of
  a broken heart, we wondered? The confident belief in an after-life brought
  comfort to many in the face of deep tragedy, and part of Bessie’s memorial

  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial">My great-grandmother
  Mary Ann would have taken the long walk to the cemetery many times for the
  funerals of friends, but also to mourn the death of family members. Three
  times between 1870 and 1874, she walked behind the tiny coffins of infant
  sons, Richard, John and Orlando, all of whom died before their first birthday.
  Her brother Hugh Datson, just a year older than Mary Ann, died in 1875
  following a mine collapse. Then, three times during the First World War she
  received news that her adult sons had died. Two lie in the graveyards of
  Flanders Field; the third was buried at sea on the way home. The names of
  these three great-uncles of mine are inscribed on the First World War monument
  in the town. My great-grandmother’s gravestone expresses the simple faith
  that survived her tragedies – of the thirteen children she bore, only six
  survived her. She died in 1934 and lies with her husband Stephen who died in
  1913. Their headstone reads simply ‘In God’s care’.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial">Nearby, lie her four
  daughters – Alice Emma, Rosina, Mary Jane and Violet –‘Resting’. I
  recalled visiting the little miners’ cottage at Moonta Mines in 1959 where
  my grandfather Stephen Williams was staying with his sisters, Alice Emma and
  Violet. Alice Emma was 93, a gaunt old woman with a wild straggle of grey
  hair. She cautioned us to watch the hole in the board floor of the living
  room, covered by a worn rug. Violet, a young 75, bustled in the kitchen,
  baking Cornish pasties for our picnic at Moonta Bay.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial">Alice Emma died the
  next year and Violet in 1972. The place where the old cottage stood is now an
  empty paddock, where weeds grow.</font></span></p>

  <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial">On the Sunday evening of the festival, we travelled to Wallaroo to hear the
  Kerwon Choir, a male voice choir drawn from across Cornwall. The Wallaroo Town
  Hall, with its rich green drapes and high ceilings decorated with elaborate
  plaster mouldings, is a fine example of turn of century country grandeur. The
  flag of Cornwall, a white cross on a black background, was prominently
  displayed. A stooped, grey-haired man, modern-day representative of the Bards
  of Cornwall whose tradition stretch back into the mists of time, parted the
  stage curtains and stood waiting as the murmur of the crowded hall subsided.
  He wore a green and black tartan kilt and leaned on a tall staff. He welcomed
  us first in the Cornish tongue and then in English, his voice the strong, soft
  burr of the southwest of England. ‘Cornwall is not a county, it’s a
  country’, he asserted, reminding us that the Cornish people, like their
  Celtic cousins in Wales, Ireland and Scotland, still view London as a foreign
  country. He spun brief humorous tales of miners and Bible salesmen before
  introducing the choir.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial">The choir’s
  repertoire traced some of the history and spirit of Cornwall. I was taken back
  to childhood memories of summer Sunday mornings of my childhood when we would
  listen to the radio, with Peter Dawson singing ‘The Cornish Floral Dance’<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial">I heard the band
  with its curious tone</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial">With cornet,
  clarinet and big trombone;</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial">Fiddle, cello, big
  bass drum,</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial">Bassoon, flute and
  euphonium.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial">Each one making the
  most of his chance –</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial">All together in the
  Floral Dance.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial">The hymns of Isaac
  Watts and Philip Bliss spoke of the central place of the Wesleyan revival of
  the eighteenth century in Cornish history. Methodism, with its emphasis on
  individualism and the possibility of improving oneself by hard work and
  personal discipline, appealed to the Cornish psyche. It fitted comfortably
  into the ordered social fabric of the mining community where there was an
  accepted hierarchy of owners, mine ‘captains’, tribute workers (who bid
  for a share of the profits from their mining efforts) and ‘tut’ workers
  (those who worked for a wage). Although the hierarchy was clearly delineated,
  individuals could, by their own hard work, move themselves up the social
  order. This contrasted with the fixed social stratification of English society
  where privilege was inherited. The Cornish share a love of singing with their
  Welsh cousins across the Bristol channel and the emotionalism of many of the
  Wesleyan hymns also sits easily with the mixture of enthusiasm and pragmatism
  that characterises the Cornish personality. The choir took us through a range
  of hymns from the triumphant ‘Jesus shall reign where’er the sun’, and
  the darkly passionate ‘When I survey the wondrous Cross’, to the tender
  ‘Let the lower lights be burning’.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial">We were then
  reminded of the fierce independence of the Cornish in the story of Bishop
  Trelawney. In 1685, France had established Catholicism as the only permitted
  religion. An attempt by James II of England to impose a similar restriction
  was opposed by several churchmen including Bishop Trelawney of Cornwall.
  Trelawney and his fellow rebels were charged with sedition and imprisoned.
  Legend has it that Cornwall assembled an army that was prepared to march on
  London to free them and the anthem ‘Trelawney’ (a synonym for Cornwall)
  celebrates this with the challenge<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font>
  </span></p>
  <blockquote>
  <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial">…and shall
  Trelawney live, or shall Trelawney die?</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial">Here’s 20,000
  Cornishmen will know the reason why!<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font>
  </span></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial">Trelawney and his
  fellow bishops were freed, and freedom of religion was established in Britain.
  The choir sang the anthem with fervor and we all stood as if for a National
  Anthem!</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial">On Saturday, under a
  sky of scudding grey cloud, we drove to Kadina for the street parade. The main
  street was lined with maypoles, the ribbons of yellow, red, green, blue, black
  and white a bright counterpoint against the sky. Each of the primary schools
  of the area was represented and the girls, with hair garlanded with flowers
  and wearing traditional starched white pinafores over long floral dresses,
  practised their steps as they waited for the music to begin. Many of the crowd
  were in traditional costume; the ‘mine workers’ in shirtsleeves,
  waistcoats and miner’s caps, a scarf knotted at the throat, and the ‘mine
  captains’ and surveyors in frock coats, cravats and bowler hats. The
  women’s costumes also reflected social status ranging from the white blouses
  and long skirts of the working class women to the satins and flounces of those
  of higher social status. The fine hats of the latter with their plumes and
  vivid colours also confirmed their status compared with the ‘jenny caps’
  of the others.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial">As I wandered among
  the crowd, it was easy to imagine the scene shifting back to an earlier time,
  and to allow the tarmac of the street to fade to dirt, with horse hitching
  posts and drinking troughs, the kerbside picked out with the local stone. The
  car, that would radically alter the world’s social fabric, was a distant
  dream, and horses stood patiently waiting in the side streets. I let nearly
  130 years drop away and allowed my imagination to create a similar celebration
  in May 1874.<o:p>

  <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Arial">T<span lang="EN-US">wo of the girls
  skipping and chatting as the wait for the music to begin are my great-aunts,
  Mary Jane, 8 years old and Alice Emma, who is 6. The older sister is one of
  the taller girls, her skinny wrists poking out from the already-too-small
  smock. She scolds her livelier sister, a pretty, vivacious scamp of a girl,
  who will not keep still and is already threatening to tangle the maypole
  ribbons. With my now-knowledge, I know that Alice Emma will be the one who, 30
  years later, will give birth to a daughter, whose birth certificate will read
  ‘father unknown’.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial">On the edge of the
  watching crowd is a small boy, about 3 or 4 years old, idly playing marbles in
  the dirt. He is dressed in the fashion of the time, shirtsleeves, waistcoat,
  and knickerbockers and long socks. His cap is a little too large for him and
  he takes it off and pushes it back on his head. He is my grandfather <a href="Stephen%20W%20Quintrell.html"> Stephen
  William</a>. A small woman, wearing a jenny cap and a starched pinny over a floral
  dress, shifts the baby on her hip, bends down and speaks to him gently. She is
  only about 30 years old, but there is sadness in her eyes, as if life has
  already dealt her some hard blows. It is Mary Ann, my great grandmother, and
  the sadness comes from having lost two infant sons less than three years
  earlier. She cannot know but Orlando, the baby on her hip, will not live to
  see Christmas.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial">Next to her stands a
  small, stocky man dressed in his Sunday-best suit, waistcoat and bowler hat.
  He is bearded in the manner of the day with a chin beard and no moustache. As
  I watch him clean and fill his pipe, I am reminded of seeing my grandfather do
  this a hundred times. He is my great-grandfather Stephen, a mine surveyor with
  the Wallaroo-Moonta Company, a position that places him slightly above the
  mineworkers, but below the mine captains and supervisors in status. He is
  talking with a big man who towers above the crowd. They are discussing the
  opening of the newly finished North Yelta Methodist church that Stephen
  designed, and exchanging concerns that attendance at meetings is less than
  hoped for. They are considering how they might encourage a greater religious
  commitment among the young men of the district who seem more interested in
  football than church.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial">The big man is my
  great-grandmother’s brother, Hugh Datson, a tall, strongly-built man who,
  although he is a respected ‘class leader’ in the Methodist Church is also
  feared for his fighting prowess. ‘A punch from Hugh Datson was like a blow
  from a hammer’ a later newspaper report claimed. Hugh will not see another
  May Day parade. On the 15<sup>th</sup> March 1875 he will be involved in a
  mine collapse and die from the shock and injuries he receives. Ironically, his
  death will spark the religious revival that he and Stephen are discussing.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial">‘[After Hugh
  Datson’s death]… a great spiritual awakening followed in all the churches
  and hundreds were swept into the Kingdom in the special services which lasted
  3 or 4 months.’<a title style="mso-footnote-id: ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span style="mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[1]</span></a><o:p>

  <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial">(It is to be hoped
  that it was the ‘spiritual awakening’ and not ‘the services’ that
  lasted 3 to 4 months!).</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial">The music begins –
  ‘The Cornish Floral Dance’ – and the children begin their skipping
  steps, weaving in and out to form the patterns of the maypole. One of the
  poles begins to rock and a young man jumps out of the crowd and comes and sits
  on the base to steady it. It is one of Hugh’s sons, Edward, who laughs and
  claps along in time with the music. When the dance is finished he takes a bow
  along with the girls, doffing his cap to the crowd. He takes his cousins Mary
  Jane and Alice’s hands and brings them back to the family group. Edward will
  be a witness to his father’s accident and death next March, and he will tell
  the coroner's enquiry<o:p>

  about 11 o’clock I was wheeling at the pitch at Hogg’s shaft. After I had
  finished wheeling, my brother asked if I was going to crib. Went with him to
  the adjoining pitch, Champions, about 10 fathoms from ours. We sat down and
  commenced eating crib, 5 of us. We had just finished and father and Peter
  Champion were talking. The ground fell without warning from above our heads.
  We called for help and the Champions, who were about 6 feet away came and got
  us out, and laid us down about 6 feet away from the place, myself, father and
  my brother, William Henry. Saw Mr Lukey, Mr Bray and the 2 Champions take my
  father away. Got up and went to see how my brother was. Asked him how he was
  getting on. He said “Pretty well.” I then, with assistance, got up as far

  to me in the crowd, wearing a bright floral dress, pinny and jenny cap shifts
  the baby on her hip. He too is dressed for the occasion in a bright floral
