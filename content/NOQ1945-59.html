          was plentiful, and Norman went to work first at Post Office, where his
          skill with sending and receiving Morse code was still relevant, and
          then to Adelaide Joinery Works, where he spent the rest of his working
          life as company secretary.<o:p>

          I remember about the next ten years are the dances, the family parties
          and sport. The Institute Library opposite the Clarence Park Railway
          Station provided a community focus for us. There were casual strolls
          of a Friday evening to the Institute Library where I devoured my
          weekly supply of books before the end of the weekend and had to wait
          until the next visit. I recall the golden light of the street lights;
          the sense that every evening was a warm, balmy Spring; and that there
          was as much time as we wanted to choose books from the treasure trove
          of the Library. Norman played electric light cricket in the nets
          adjacent to the Institute and I longed to be big enough to play too. I
          can still hear the long dying notes of the Last Post at the Anzac Day
          memorial services in the Institute Hall, the bugle played by my
          father, and his voice as I heard for the first time the now-familiar
          words<o:p>
          </o:p>

          were the days of Guy Fawkes Night, a huge bonfire at the end of our
          block every November 5<sup>th</sup>. In the days before greater
          prudence demanded the restriction of fireworks, we squirreled away
          savings to buy sky rockets, Catherine wheels, Mount Vesuvius&apos;s,
          Roman Candles, and penny and three&mdash;penny bangers. The weeks before Guy
          Fawkes would be spent planning our own pyrotechnical display, always
          saving the more expensive and dramatic sky rockets until last.<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </span></p>
          <p class="MsoBodyText" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">It
          seemed that, during the decade after the war, wherever I turned there
          was my father. He was MC at all the dances, leading off the dances
          with my mother and the toast&mdash;master at weddings. When square dancing
          became the craze in the 1950, he and Olive took it up with gusto, and
          he tried his hand at calling the dances. He was at every baseball
          game. He learned the art of scoring, becoming the official scorer when
          summer night baseball began in Adelaide, and was scorer for the
          interstate baseball series. At 50, he was still playing parklands
          cricket &mdash; a competent wicketkeeper and middle-order batsman.<o:p>

          <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">My
          parents dug up the whole back yard at Byron Rd and planted huge beds
          of flowers and Olive started a florist&apos;s business from home. Then,
          when Olive went to work at central Florists in the Adelaide Central
          market, they flattened the whole area out again and turned it into a
          tennis court. When the interstate baseball series was held in Adelaide
          in 1950, we entertained all the teams at a barbecue at our house. It
          was not uncommon for there to be similar parties of families and
          friends &mdash; barbecues, a keg of beer (and a careful eye on any young
          ones who tried to sample it!), plenty of soft drinks, and plates and
          plates of cakes and sausage rolls prepared by &apos;the baseball
          wives&apos;.<o:p>

          father inculcated into me the importance of fair play, of accepting
          the umpire&apos;s decision, and of always giving your best. I recall an
          incident where I had made a play in a baseball game that was within a
          strict interpretation of the rules, but of doubtful sportsmanship. In
          a conversation after the game, the umpire suggested to my father that
          I had cheated. I don&apos;t remember the words my father used in relaying
          this conversation to me, but he was obviously torn between the need to
          defend his own family against the umpire&apos;s challenge, and his sense
          that I had indeed transgressed some unwritten code of decency.<o:p>
          </o:p>

          <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">In
          1951, the day after we had celebrated his 21<sup>st</sup> birthday,
          Bob went overseas. I know Norman wasn&apos;t all that keen on Bob&apos;s
          trip. My brother had fallen under the spell of a &apos;fast-talking
          Yank&apos;<a title style="mso-footnote-id: ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span style="mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[1]</span></a>
          (I think these were my father&apos;s sentiments!), and had been persuaded
          to try his hand at baseball in the USA. Bob had also fallen in love
          with a dazzling Californian blonde, so my father&apos;s advice had little
          influence against the irresistible twin forces of sport and sex. (For
          the Canadians &mdash; the rest is history!!).<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </span></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">By
          1950, we had moved from our Byron Rd house to Belair Rd &mdash; another
          newly-built house. During our time at Byron Rd, Norman&apos;s father had
          come to live with us, and Gramp had his own small room added to the
          garage. Gramp then became a permanent fixture in our family, along
          with my mother&apos;s Aunt Chrissie<a title style="mso-footnote-id: ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><span style="mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[2]</span></a>,

          father&apos;s summing up of people was usually accurate. The
          &apos;fast-talking Yank&apos; did turn out to be a con&mdash;man and later fell
          foul of the law. I also recall him trying to gently warn me away from
          association with a couple of men. His warning was too oblique for the
          adolescent me to grasp but I later realised that the men in question
          were gay, and he was trying to protect me from inappropriate
          encounters!<o:p>

          1953, Norman and Olive celebrated their 25<sup>th</sup> wedding
          anniversary, with friends and family. In the photo, they are both
          showing extra weight, Olive at last losing the gaunt figure of the war
          years. In my father&apos;s hand is the ever&mdash;present cigarette. He smoked
          for as long as I can remember, a significant contributor to my early

          parents did all they could to welcome them home, but work was not easy
          to get for Bob, Trish longed for home, and in 1956, we farewelled them
          again. As Bob, Trish and Burk were sailing off to Canada, another
          significant meeting was occurring. At a church camp, Charmian and I
          met. It is clear that my father had good judgement as, in his quiet
          and unobtrusive way, he spoke approvingly of Charmian from the early
          days, and less warmly of other girls I took out during the three years
          of Charmian and my on&mdash;again, off&mdash;again courtship. My grandfather was
          much more direct in his assessment of Charmian who definitely had his
          &apos;seal of approval&apos; from early on! Charmian and I married in 1959,
          just after I had graduated, and a month before my parents left for
          Canada. Their generosity to us and our children over the next twelve
          years was wonderful. They gave us significant material assistance, but
          more importantly they gave us time and affection. In retrospect, we
          see how much their gifts of extended child minding that allowed us
          &apos;time out&apos; together contributed to the strength of our marriage.<o:p>
