          Olive tells the story that she and Norman had decided to have a
          competition to see who could save the most from their wages for their
          overseas trip. Olive was by this time working full time at a florist
          in the city. Needless to say, she completely eclipsed Norman&apos;s
          effort, a further reminder of her ability to be frugal, and my
          father&apos;s tendency still to pick up the tab! Adelaide Joinery Works
          were generous employers, giving Norman paid holidays well beyond what
          was legally required of them, and funding his attendance at a lumber
          conference in Chicago. In the photographs &mdash; one on the chairlift on
          Grouse Mountain and one on the Queen Mary from New York to London –
          they look relaxed, happy and like they are having a bloody good time!<o:p>

          the space of time between leaving and returning to Adelaide, they had

          Stacey. Charmian and I remain very grateful to my parents for their
          generosity to us in the first years of our marriage. I had just
          finished University and begun work, and between us Charmian and I had
          nothing put by. Olive and Norman had sold their house (by this time
          Richmond Rd, Westbourne Park), and left us to &apos;mind&apos; some of their
          furniture while they were away, saving us from having to outlay money
          we didn&apos;t have on furniture of our own. Their wedding present to us
          was the most practical piece of furniture for newlyweds &mdash; a double

          1960, Norman&apos;s father died, aged 89. Self&mdash;involved with a family of
          my own, I took little notice of the impact this had on him. Although I
          judge us to have been a happy family, we did not share feelings,
          especially not sad feelings, very much. This was very apparent in
          1964, when Bob came to visit. Trish had let my parents know that their
          marriage was in trouble, but asked them not to speak of it unless Bob
          introduced the subject. In the fashion of our family, nothing was said
          throughout the visit. In a photo taken at the Hotel Australia, we are
          all smiling for the camera except Norman, who is looking sideways at
          Bob. I wonder what was in his thoughts?<o:p>

          the 1960s, Norman continued to work at Adelaide Joinery, and resisted
          suggestions that he might retire. He and Olive (still with Chrissie in
          tow) had moved several times and were now living in a small unit at
          Toorak Gardens. In the late 1960s, Norman developed
          non-insulin-dependent diabetes, and its common companion,
          hypertension. <o:p>

          had returned to Australia and was entering a difficult phase of his
          life. I know that my parents agonised over this, but it seemed to take
          more of a toll of my father. He was looking aged. I probably didn&apos;t
          help. This was the time of the Vietnam war protests and I took up a
          position in opposition to the war, which included participation in the
          peace marches and writing letters to the editor. Little was said
          directly about my stance, but I learned through Mum that he was
          disappointed at my stance. For Norman, whose brother and uncles had
          fought in WW1 and who had himself fought in WW2, this seemed like a
          betrayal and a lack of patriotism. He had always been a conservative
          voter and now his younger son was sporting stickers on his car
          advocating support for the Opposition party! However, there were no
          direct confrontations, no raised voices, just oblique references and
          quiet messages on the side from my mother.<o:p>

          our different political stances, I never sensed disapproval. The
          overwhelming memory I have of my father is of his unfailing interest
          and support. Even when my brother was at his lowest and things at
          their most difficult, my parents never flinched from providing
          practical support and, if there was disapproval, it was seldom shown.
          Even though they clearly did not like Bob&apos;s second wife, they
          nevertheless did their best to swallow their disapproval and act
          civilly to her.<o:p>

          <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">By
          1973, Norman was obviously unwell and was unwilling to travel far from
          Adelaide. He still delighted in his grandchildren and he and Olive
          often cared for our children while we had time out. He had cut his
          working hours down to two days a week, and in June 1974 he finally
          retired. A few days later he was admitted to Daws Rd Hospital with
          congestive heart failure and prostatic cancer. He was hospitalised for
          nearly four months and died in October 1974. In the funeral notice,
          Bob and I wrote that we remembered his &apos;warm and generous life&apos;,
          and these words still stay with me as I think of him.<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </span></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">He
          was committed to the welfare of his family and, no matter what my
          brother or I may have got up to, he was resolutely there for us. If
          criticism or punishment was deserved, it was meted out with
          gentleness. In an era when it was acceptable, in fact probably
          expected, to smack children for misdemeanours, my father never struck
          me. <o:p>
          </o:p>

          <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">He
          was not a religious person, but was tolerant of those who were &mdash;
          although appropriately sceptical of those who were too fanatical. He
          was a life&mdash;long Freemason, as his father had been before him, and he
          took responsible positions in the Freemasons&apos; Lodge. At his funeral,
          tributes were received from both the Lodge and baseball fraternities.
          He had a gently paternalistic attitude to people of colour, holding
          that the fact that white folk ran the world indicated of their
          superiority! He felt that indigenous Australians should be left to
          their own devices on their tribal lands &mdash; an untenable position
          today! He was well&mdash;respected at work as a fair and firm manager, and
          in social settings he was gregarious and well-liked. He enjoyed his
          beer but I seldom saw him the worse for drink. However, his beer
          consumption undoubtedly contributed to his weight and the later NIDD. <o:p>

          <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">I
          remember him in the post&mdash;war years as full of energy and fun. He was
          warm-hearted, hospitable and generous with time and money. He relied
          on my mother to manage money, as he was too generous with it. The
          story of their meeting says it all!<o:p>
