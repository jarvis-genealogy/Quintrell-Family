      Dear grandmother,
      </font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">
      We have never met, you and I. By the time I was born, 
      you had been dead for 18 years, so you never held me and I never knew 
      what it was like to have a grandmother’s love and attention. Now, over 80 
      years since you died, I want to know who you were and what life was like 
      for you in the years you lived. My mother – your daughter Olive – was 
      barely 14 when you died and told me little about you, just that you died 
      in the influenza epidemic of 1919. Recent conversations with other family 
      members suggest that Mum either did not know differently or was less than 
      honest about the circumstances of your death. Knowing Mum’s style, I can well believe that it was a mixture of denial and of ‘not 
      speaking ill of the dead’.
      </font> </p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">
      Grandmother, I want to try to paint a portrait of you 
      as a young woman. I am going to have to rely on bits and pieces to 
      assemble this portrait – Mum’s limited stories, hints and whispers of oral 
      history that consistency has firmed into fact, historical records, and 
      what I can guess at from the few family photographs I have been able to 
      gather. When I have finished, I will not be able to know how closely the 
      picture I have drawn fits. If it is too fanciful, and especially if it is 
      too unkind, please forgive me, but I want to bring you out of the shadowy 
      one-dimensional figure of my mother’s report, and give you to your 
      descendants as flesh and blood. For certainly, if the stories I have heard 
      are even partly true, there was fire in you and it was passion, not 
      influenza, that carried you to any early grave.
      </font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">
      Let me begin with your times. Your Adelaide would have 
      been a very different place from mine. We would each have known the neat 
      grid of Adelaide’s streets laid out by Colonel William Light, and the 
      parklands would have ringed the city then as now. But the streets of your 
      girlhood would not have been lit by electric light. That didn’t happen 
      until 1900, by which time you were married with two children. You would 
      have heard the debates about Federation and would have seen the birth of 
      the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901. The school leaving age was 13. I 
      wonder if, like many young women of your time, you left school to help 
      your mother care for your eight younger brothers and sisters.
      </font> </p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">
      The earliest photograph I have of you 
      <span lang="en-au">is a carefully posed one</span> taken in 1911 
      when you were 30 years old. You are sitting under some kind of fruit tree, 
      looking at my mother, Olive<span lang="en-au"> </span>is standing on a 
      chair, picking fruit. Olive is wearing a pretty white dress with 
      lace at the hem, and her hair hangs down in ringlets. You have a book open 
      in your lap, and your right hand is placed pensively under your chin. You 
      are wearing a dark-coloured dress with a broad white lace collar and your 
      hair is piled on top of your head in the fashion of the day. Your figure 
      is slim. I try to interpret your expression – a half-smile indicates 
      affection for your daughter, but there is a hint of sadness about the 
      eyes, and the suggestion of a frown.
      </font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">
      It is not hard to imagine you as 15. You would have 
      been slim and vivacious and men would have found you attractive. Some time 
      in 1897, you must have met Fred Scott, a small, neat man, quick in his 
      movements, with a fetching smile and an engaging sense of humour. Before 
      the end of the year a serious relationship had developed between you two 
      for, on 25<sup>th</sup> August 1898, you and he were married. Twenty-four 
      hours Alice May Scott was born.
      </font> </p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">
      When did your parents find out that you were pregnant? 
      The fact that Alice’s birth is recorded as a mere day after your wedding 
      suggests some possible answers. One is that you were able to hide the fact 
      of your pregnancy until the last moment and that hasty preparations for 
      marriage were made, getting you to the church just on time. Another is 
      that it wasn’t until Alice was actually born that things came to light 
      and, as was not uncommon, the birth was not registered until some days 
      later, a kindly Registrar making Alice’s arrival ‘legitimate’. 
      <span lang="en-au">It's also possible that there has been a transcription 
      error in recording dates but, w</span>hatever 
      the story, you were a mother and wife by the age of 16 years and 5 months. 
      Fred was 20. Sixteen months later, Arnie was born - on New Years’ Day, 
      1900 - followed by Cyril in March, 1902 and Olive in March, 1905. All the 
      Pearce sons were butchers, so it is possible that Fred was taken into the 
      family business. As a small child I can recall visiting Grandpa Fred’s 
      shop and receiving the <span lang="en-au">traditional</span> slice of bung fritz.
      </font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">
      Now we come to the ‘potted palm’ photo. The whole 
      Pearce family is assembled. The rather dignified-looking grandfather, 
      Edwin William and the decidedly sour-looking grandmother, Carry, are 
      seated at the front. Edwin has his arm around my mother, who is about 5 or 
      6 years old. You are standing centrally, flanked by your heavy-browed 
      brothers and your sister Maudie. Fred appears to be ma<span lang="en-au">r</span>ginalised at the 
      extreme left of the photo. You still look strikingly attractive – a little 
      fuller in the face and figure than two years before, but you still command 
      attention. You have your hand placed on the back of your mother’s chair. 
      It is easy to imagine that you are trying to make contact, to gain her 
      approval. A table with a potted palm is strategically placed in front of 
      your stomach. You are pregnant again - but not by your husband.
      </font> </p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">
      Recently – who can say when – you have begun an affair 
      with a family friend and the child in your womb is his. This seems to have 
      been known by all the family. How did it come to light<span lang="en-au">?</span> Did you confess? 
      Were you and Fred no longer intimate? Were you and your lover caught <i>in 
      flagrante</i>? In 1915, young Lily is born, half-sister to my mother. She 
      is brought up in the family but taunted by her eldest sister over her 
      parenthood.
      </font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">
      In 1914, war was declared in Europe<span lang="en-au">.</span> Fred enlisted 
      in the Catering Corps and was sent to France. It has been suggested that 
      part of his motivation was your love affair: that he was hurt and wanted 
      some distance. Perhaps he hoped that your ardor for your lover would cool. 
      If so, it appears that he was wrong.
      </font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">
      ‘It was very sad,’ my mother told me of your death. ‘My 
      father only three weeks home from the War and mother dead in the influenza 
      epidemic. I was forced to go to her funeral,’ she continued, ‘and they 
      made me go up and kiss my mother in her coffin. It was horrible! I will 
      never go to another funeral again.’
      </font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">
      The story I have received from my mother’s cousin is 
      quite different. ‘I was staying with your grandmother at the time, she 
      told me. I loved staying with Auntie Lily. Your Mum was my favourite 
      cousin and she and I spent a lot of time together. Your grandmother was 
      ill in bed, and young Lily came and took me out to the laundry. &quot;Look at 
      what they’ve taken from my mother&quot;, she said, and showed me a basin of 
      blood. We were shooed away. It seems that when Fred came home from France, 
      he found that the affair hadn’t cooled and that Lily was pregnant again. 
      Maybe your grandmother died from the ‘flu but, more likely, from a 
      haemorrhage brought on by a botched abortion attempt.’
      </font></p>
        <font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
      </font>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">
      Is that true, grandmother? Is this more lurid story of 
      your death accurate? Would my mother have known and deliberately distorted 
      the story? Or would the facts have been hidden from her? It would be 
      consistent with my mother’s style, using denial to deal with unpleasant 
      information. It would also offer some explanation for my mother’s rather 
      modest attitude towards sex. Alternatively, perhaps you did die of 
      influenza and your niece’s story is a fabrication. Whatever is true, 
      please forgive me if I lean towards the more scandalous explanation. It 
      seems to rescue you from the wintry gloom of my mother’s report and put 
      flesh on your bones. It makes you more tempestuous and earthy - less 
      ephemeral. In the last photograph I have of you, you are 37 years old, 
      overweight, serious, and glum. The fine features are gone, your mouth is 
      turned down at the corners, and your hair is thin and straggly. Your eyes 
      look at the camera with resignation. I can only guess at how life 
      experiences may have wrought changes to your psyche as well as your 
      physique.
      </font> </p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">
      I am sorry we never met. I would have liked to know 
      about your dreams and hopes, about how you dealt with your failures and 
      disappointments. What music did you like? Were you a good dancer, a lively 
      conversationalist, a dutiful daughter? What were your greatest pleasures, 
      your deepest sadness?
      </font> </p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">
      I leave this story for your and my descendants. I trust 
      that it is not unkind.
      </font></p>
