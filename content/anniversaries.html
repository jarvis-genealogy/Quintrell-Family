      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Dear Bob,</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">I’m going to suspend disbelief and enter that 
      imaginary, eternal moment you spoke of - you and Dad sitting in heaven, 
      sharing a beer. It’s heaven, so you don’t have to worry any more about 
      whether this drink will set you on the slippery slope into alcoholism. 
      Even better, the first taste of the beer on your tongue – cold and biting, 
      the refreshing bubbles dancing around your mouth – will be repeated over 
      and over for eternity.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Why am I writing today? Two reasons. Look at the date. 
      It’s Dad’s birthday. So, happy 101<sup>st</sup>, Dad. I miss you and, as 
      you know now, wish I’d responded better to your kindness and interest when 
      I was younger. But, in the heaven I’m imagining, all is forgiven and only 
      the best times are remembered.</font> </p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">There’s a second reason for this letter. A few days 
      ago, I attended the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary re-union of players from 
      the initial Night Baseball series at Norwood Oval, so I’m swimming in a 
      sea of nostalgia, and I’d love you to be able to dive in and join me.</font> </p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">It was a perfect Adelaide autumn day<span lang="en-au">, 
      t</span>he sky 
      cloudless, the sun a blessing on your skin, and the merest whisper of a 
      breeze. Over fifty old players and officials gathered at Thebarton Oval, 
      connected by one thing only, their participation in the first series of 
      night baseball to be played in Australia in 1952-53. We lunched together, 
      seated in team tables, and then lined up in our teams for an official 
      acknowledgement. The league president told the crowd of about 300, who 
      were there for the summer season’s grand final, that we were the ones who drew crowds of between six and ten 
      thousand people to watch baseball on a summer’s evening in the 
      pre-television fifties. Our names were called and we were presented 
      individually to the small crowd.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The thing that struck me over and over was how little 
      people had changed. Oh, we had aged – grown fatter, balder, greyer – but 
      even though we moved more stiffly and slowly, we recognised each other; Gordon Fidock’s loose-limbed walk, Jimmy Kostoglou’s silky-smooth gait, 
      Donny Martin’s cocky strut and, if anyone had yelled ‘slide!’, you would 
      have expected Chibby Haynes to hit the ground headfirst. Kingsley 
      Wellington’s slightly aloof manner that had always intimidated me was 
      unchanged, and nobody would have been at all surprised if umpire Warren 
      Charles had ejected a player deemed to be acting inappropriately. Peter 
      Box looked as if he could still strike out the side, and Chalky White 
      would have dared him to try. Brian Hill’s and Gerry 
      Robert’s welcoming smiles were as warm and encouraging as ever. Bob Brock 
      had ridden his motorbike all the way from Queensland: who would have 
      expected anything else? The dead were also there in spirit and named 
      respectfully – Bill and Arthur Radbone, Bob McMahon and so on. Tell our 
      cousin Jeff that he got a mention, and that many of the old players from 
      the Redsox asked after him.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Remember that first game, Dad, how the main stand was 
      packed and people stretched right around the mounds down the left- and 
      right-field lines? It was November 1952 and I had just turned 15. Sam 
      Sutton and I manned the scoreboard out in right-field. A cool breeze from 
      the south ruffled the flags on the grandstand as the teams ran out through 
      the players’ race for the first game. Remember the sounds? The slap of 
      leather as the pitcher’s first pitch hit the catcher’s glove, the crack of 
      ball on wood as the first batter grounded to the shortstop, the smack of 
      the ball into the first-baseman’s glove beating the runner by a step, the 
      emphatic ‘Y’re out!’ from the umpire, his arm jerking up in confirmation, 
      and the roar of disappointment from the crowd. On the field the chief 
      umpire took out his whiskbroom and cleaned sand off the plate as the 
      infield snapped the ball around, chattering encouragement to each other. 
      Up in the stand the official scorer marked his strange symbols on the 
      neatly-ruled score sheet and turned his attention to the next play.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">I’d like to remember that the scorer was you, Dad, even 
      though I know that it wasn’t until the next season that you sat there with 
      your range of coloured pencils – green for hits, red for errors, blue for 
      srikeouts – and adjudicated on hits and errors. Your scoring reflected 
      your own personality, generously ready to assign hits rather than errors 
      where there was doubt. I still have the engraved silver tray they gave you 
      for your services – ‘Presented to Norm Quintrell by Night Baseball League 
      in appreciation of services rendered: 1953-4’. I took it along to the 
      reunion and considered donating it as part of the memorabilia they are 
      collecting into a Museum. But I’m not ready to give it up just yet, and I 
      brought it home again.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">I spent a long time in the Museum, looking at old 
      photographs. There you were, Bob, looking at me from the photo of the 1949 
      championships in Melbourne alongside Bill Fuller. And again in 1950, your 
      All-Australian year, with Neil Harvey, the great cricketer, in the same 
      photo. It was after one of these series you had your first cigarette, so 
      you told me. That’s a piece of history I’d like to have seen taken a 
      different turn.</font> </p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">There are photographs of me too in schoolboy teams. In 
      Sydney in 1953, when we played on the baked turf at Parramatta, ground 
      balls skidding through as if skimming off glass. I think I made five 
      errors in the series! Another in Melbourne in 1954, when we won the series 
      for the third straight time and I made All-Australian. In the same year, I 
      won the Pomeroy Cup for best and fairest in the schoolboy competition, a 
      trophy you had won seven years earlier.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">I spent some time in front of photographs of the night 
      series at Norwood. There was a sepia-toned enlargement in a heavy wooden
      frame of 
      the first night game - taken from the right-field side at just about the 
      angle Sam and I would have seen from the scoreboard. It’s a photograph 
      from another era, like the studio photographs of my great-grandparents 
      that hang on my wall and, to today’s players, probably has the same 
      strange sense of detachment.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">As we stood in the autumn sunshine, hearing the roll 
      call of our names as if we were heroes of legend, I watched the current 
      players warming up for the grand final. They moved with fluid grace, 
      muscle and sinew responsive to command, unselfconscious in their beauty. 
      And for a few minutes as the sun warmed our aging bones, we old players 
      were once again fifty years younger and full of our own potential.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Arial">******************</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">‘Neil, you can hit for Kingsley.’</font> </p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">It’s Arthur Radbone calling my name. I search among the 
      bats for my choice, move into the on-deck circle, and take some nervous 
      practice swings. The lights, which seemed so bright when I viewed them 
      from the stands, now appear much dimmer, and the chatter on the field and 
      the barracking from the stands much louder. Now that I am near the action, 
      the pitcher’s fast ball seems to have increased in velocity and his curve 
      is suddenly breaking twice as far. The hitter at the plate lifts a soft 
      fly to the second baseman and I walk to the plate. There are two out, the 
      game is tied and we have a runner on third. Nothing hangs on this game. 
      It’s the last of the season, we are out of the race, and the result will 
      be meaningless. But this is my first at-bat in a senior game and the 
      lights and sounds are all around, hammering at me as I stand in. The 
      pitcher - Warren Charles, near the end of his playing career and soon to 
      become a respected senior umpire – goes into his jerky motion and 
      fires the ball at the plate. I swing wildly at three balls off the plate 
      and strike out. In the field, I handle the couple of ground balls that 
      come my way without mishap, but in a second visit to the plate, I again 
      strike out dismally, and my brief foray into the first night season is 
      over.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> <font face="Arial"> But for that brief cameo appearance, I may now stand in the autumn 
      sunshine with old heroes on one side and young champions on the other, and 
      savour one brief moment of nostalgia for what was once and will not be 
      again.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">So, here’s to you Bob – who taught me the skills of the 
      game – and to you Dad -who taught me its ethics. I toast your memory.</font></p>
