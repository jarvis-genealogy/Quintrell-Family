      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">I was born at Moonta Mines on the 5<sup>th</sup> of 
      July 1871. My father was born at Liscard, Cornwall, and mother at Redruth,
      Penzance, England so, by that, as a friend said to me once when asking 
      what Nationality I was, parents both from Cornwall and myself Moonta 
      Mines, that I was a pure Cornishman. I went to school at an early age to 
      the Mines Model School and was one of the first scholars when it opened 
      under Headmaster Dr W. G. Torr. Moonta Mines at that period was at its 
      best. My father was a Surveyor Draughtsman under Mr H R Hancock. We 
      shifted to Adelaide in 1881 and I went to the Tynte St [School] under Mr 
      Gill. In 1885, I entered the Government Service in the Water Conservation 
      Department under J. W. Jones, Conservator. While there I worked in the 
      office in the new Government Building, Victoria Square. After 18 months at 
      2/6, and never cared for indoor work, I went into the field with the 
      Surveyor, and my first job, I was sent away north to Yadlamalka, north 
      from Port Augusta under W. W. Mills, surveying along the west side of the 
      Flinders Range towards Warrakimbo, Marachowie and Mt Eyre which was a 
      deserted township used in the old </font> <i><font face="Arial">[illegible].</font></p>
      </i>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">On completion there, we came back and travelled through 
      the Pichi Ritchi Pass to the east side of the range to Quorn, then on to 
      the Te Tee Va Springs at the mouth of Depot Ck, where we made our camp, 
      then worked along the range towards Mt Ragless and Ardenvale. Depot Creek 
      Gorge runs through the Range from the east to the west side. While there I 
      climbed to the top of Mt Arden and repaired the Trig. On top of Mt Arden 
      you get a glorious view. Looking towards the west you can see the Tent 
      Hills onning(?), Lake Torrens to the south, Mt Brown to the north across 
      the saltbush plains as far as Mt Desolation, and to the east Mt Ragless 
      and the Willochra Plains. It&apos;s worth the climb for the view.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">On completion of our work there, we came back and 
      travelled north past Hawker and Hooking to the Moralina Creek at the mouth 
      of Wilpena Pound. One thing I remember while at the Depot Creek camp: we 
      went to a party at Ardenvale township – nearly all German settlers and I 
      had my first experience of a German bed, a feather bed and <i>[illegible].</i> 
      From Moralina we worked along the old survey line and then on to
      Parachilna, and pitched our camp at the well at the mouth of the Oratunga 
      Gorge, and through the pass to Blinman. At Parachilna, the hotel was kept 
      by Bill Darmody, and the Blinman Hotel by Remington Barnes of Shootover 
      fame – Adelaide Birthday cup 1888.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">We worked along the Breakfastime to Wilpena and 
      surroundings. At the Oratunga, I met up with Bob Caldwell afterwards. The 
      next time I met Bob was when he was Resident Engineer for the Railways. 
      After finishing our work there, we called to Adelaide camp and horses. We 
      came back through Hawker, Craddock, Hanawerie(?), Terrowie, Burra, Kapunda 
      to the Survey yards, Thebarton and disbanded. My camp mates were Surveyor 
      W. W. Mills; Jack Fotheringham and myself, chainmen; Sam Moore, axeman; H 
      Edeina (?), teamster; and Newt Gregory, cook.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b><font face="Arial">1885 to 1888.</font></b></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">My next job was with was with Surveyor J. S. Furner, 
      surveying and leveling from Woodside through Lobethal, Cudlee Creek and 
      Millbrook, also <i>[illegible].</i> Then I was at B. Hill until the 1892 
      Strike started and then we were all scattered to different stations. I was 
      lucky, being sent to the SouthEast, and was not sorry as the Typhoid Fever 
      was prevalent. Silverton and B Hill hospitals were full.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">South East: I started in the South East at Naracoorte 
      and it was a great contrast to the dry north. It was winter time and 
      [with] the rains and the water laying about, it seemed a different 
      countree (sic). Superintendent was C. F. Girback and afterwards, W. 
      Miller; leading fitters Curly Howbel(?), Tom Kingdon; Henry Gens was 
      apprentice - afterwards Mine Host of Gens Hotel, Mt Gambier; Steve 
      Staunton, blacksmith; H. S. Hamilton; clerk and P. Prince. Afterwards I 
      was sent to Bordertown where I had the misfortune, on turning the engine 
      on the turntable, to get my left foot crushed and opened badly. Bob 
      Stephenson was the driver and I was off for several months. On resuming 
      work at Naracoorte on the roads to Kingston, Mt Gambier to Bordertown, 3<sup>rd</sup> 
      rail for narrow gauge … <i>[illegible]</i> … to Bordertown and Mt Gambier 
      and Beachport with different enginemen; Jack Eager, W Cornell, P Crafter, 
      Jack Smith, Amby (?) Snell, Jim Mackie, Amos Clark.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">In 1894, I got married to my dear wife, Edith Long in 
      the Wesleyan Church by the Nara Creek, and was transferred to Kingston to 
      fire for Charlie Hall, Kingston and Naracoorte line. I was 7 years at 
      Kingston with Charlie and I enjoyed every day of it there. Most of the 
      latter years we were working 3 days a week, except in the wool season. 
      Sport, cricket and football, of which I was the captain, and foot racing. 
      There was plenty of fast runners, good Sheffield runners in J McKinnon, 
      Pinkerton&apos;s son Martin, Tapfield of Black Ford, Charley Threadgold of 
      Murray Bend. While I was there I had the knowledge of what a real 
      earthquake was like, an experience of which I&apos;ll never forget. It was 
      supposed to be a Marine Volcano at sea off Cape Jaffa erupting, and for 
      several months, the shakes continued. I had to go 3 days a week on a trip 
      up to Naracoorte and you could hear the rumble of the shakes coming from 
      Cape Jaffa and feel the shake passing the old galvanised shed, and the 
      iron girders shaking and rattling and rumbling north towards Murrabinna 
      way, making you feel very queer until you got used to it. In 1894 Roy was 
      born, during the earthquake season.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">After years at Kingston, I got rated as a fireman at 
      eight shillings per day, and while there Ralph was born in 1898 and Norman 
      in 1902. While there I had my first trip in charge of an engine – 
      Naracoorte and Wolsley and back, Bert Rumball as fireman. After a time, I 
      was transferred to Mt Gambier, and this time it was disastrous for 
      Depression set in and 18 enginemen and 18 firemen were reduced in rank. I 
      was one of the unlucky ones. I was reduced from 8 shillings a day to 6/6 
      but the irony of it was, although I was reduced in status, I was still 
      doing the same work, but at reduced pay and it rankled. [From] Mt Gambier 
      we ran trains to Beachport and Wolsley. While at Mt Gambier, Edie and I 
      saw the opening of the tower at the top of the Mount overlooking the 
      Valley Lake – a good view from the top of the mount looking south to Port 
      McDonnell, where Edie was born, and Mt Shank, another extinct volcano. We 
      lived at Whel St, Mt Gambier. Mt Gambier is a very pretty place, but wet 
      in the winter, but the water does not lay about owing to the hollow 
      ground. Gambier [people] are proud of their lakes – Blue Lake, Leg of 
      Mutton Lake and Valley Lake. During the wet season, with Roy with the 
      croup and Norman also, Mt Gambier weather was detrimental to the health of 
      Norman&apos;s health (sic). The doctor advised us it [was] best to go north to 
      a drier climate, so I got a transfer to Pt Pirie. There I started on the 
      BHP Shunter with Shunt Engineman A. H. Bevell. I was not long in Pirie 
      before I got reinstated as a fireman at 9 shillings a day. Pirie did not 
      seem an advantage for a while. There is no beauty about it but … <i>
      [illegible]…</i> plenty of life and splendid people and the friends we 
      made there remained friends, although, sad to say, the only ones remaining 
      is dear Mrs Daly and family.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">We had a bad start when we arrived in Pt Pirie as 
      Norman took very ill and it was tough … <i>[illegible]… </i>with him we 
      had to keep him in cotton wool most of the time he was ill. While at 
      Pirie, my brothers Clarrie, Jack and Dick came there to work, and stopped 
      with us. At Pirie there was a fine lot of fellows to work with; most of 
      them are dead now – mates on the road. I fired for Jack Coulson, J.B. 
      Shrives, Alf Holthouse, W Alderson, Drivers; Tommy Hart(?), C. Job, Tom 
      Brennan, Jack McFarlane, Jack Mackie and a lot of others. While at Pt 
      Pirie I was borrowed by the Marine Board for a time to relieve their 
      engineer, taking charge of their engines to work on the long jetty. They 
      had 2 small engines, a SAR Narrow Gauge V, and a Kitson pump engine. I was 
      sent as I had experience [with] a Tange pump engine on the diamond 
      drilling. My work was to load the Celtic Queen sailing ship with wheat. 
      There was one mishap. I started with the V as I thought she could pull the 
      heaviest load. I worked the V for one day and on lighting her after 
      getting steam, I was filling her tank with water when the corner of the 
      firebox blew out. I was not long getting the fire out. The engine shed was 
      on the jetty. I sent word to Pt Pirie about the mishap, and Mr Hill, 
      Superintendent came. He took the coal pick and went underneath. He found 
      that he could punch holes all around the foundation of the firebox as she 
      was eaten all round. He told the Harbourmaster they did send a man over a 
      man (sic) to work taking such risk and without an examination.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Pt Pirie is a lively place. When I first [got there] I 
      got out at Pirie South and walked down Ellen St. The trains – passenger 
      and shunt – ran the length [of the main street]. The mineral trains from 
      Broken Hill ran down the street to the smelting works, pushing the trucks 
      ahead, with a porter ringing a bell. When a Yankee engine No 48 ran the 
      ore up to a bin and the refinery, I don&apos;t think any city anywhere else is 
      like that. Also, Ellen St [has] one side shops and pubs and the other 
      wharf, ships, big timber stacks. The train left Pirie every day for 
      Petersburg, Jamestown, and Gladstone to Hamley Bridge.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">I was in one accident while we were there, when coming 
      into Petersburg Station and the signals showing &apos;all clear&apos;, we crashed 
      into &apos;Big Ben&apos;, a T Class engine which had stopped at the points 
      controlling the main line and the railway yards line. I was firing a Y 
      class engine of a mixed train with my mate Alf Holthouse. We caught Big 
      Ben in the centre. Our engine, a Beyer and Plack English-built (and what 
      splendid iron and steel was put into her!), she put the big engine over on 
      her side and cut her rods cylinder - cut them off like cutting through 
      cheese – and our engine fell over and buckled up. I did not remember much 
      as I was unconscious, and the tender and coal covered me until they could 
      release me. I suffered with bruised ribs and body, and shock, and [was] 
      sent back to Pirie to be doctored by Dr Hampton-Carr. I was off for a 
      while, and on my return to work I started with J Coulson on a Race Train 
      for Balaklava, and started when Coulson sang out &apos;Look out!&apos;. They had the 
      points set for the loco and we crashed into the dead engines in the loco 
      shed. I got another shock and I left the engine and walked home.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">In 1911, I was made a 3<sup>rd</sup> class fireman and 
      was transferred to Petersburg, and started once more on the Cockburn 
      roads. I was not long at Petersburg before I got another accident. I ran a 
      Class Y, just off the stocks, for a trial trip to Belalie and was on the 
      pit at Loco when the Chargeman, Alf Stevens, ran out to tell me 10 big 
      trucks had got away from the shunting yard and were running down the grade 
      to the Loco. I was alone on the engine. I ran with the engine to meet them 
      so to prevent them running into the running sheds there were fitters and 
      cleaners underneath them. I saw them coming fast and reversed to run with 
      them and then reversed until they were just on me, and started steaming 
      against the funnel. I opened the regulator and started steaming against 
      them until we reached the running shed. We gave the engine in the shed a 
      broken … <i>[illegible] …</i> but no one got hurt. Damage – a few trucks.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Just before this happened, some trucks broke away from 
      a train at Natabibbi, and the guard jumped into a big truck and put the 
      hand brake on and stopped them. He got a bonus of 50 pounds. S Kidman the 
      big cattleman happened to be riding passenger with him. J C Sharpe, the 
      foreman, came to me and said &quot;Well, Mr Man, Jimmy Keane got 50 pounds the 
      other day for his job of stopping 3 trucks, so I expect a bottle of 
      Champagne when you get yours. I said, &quot;Righto!&quot;. A few days [later] he 
      called me into the office. &quot;here&apos;s a letter for you from the 
      Commissioner&apos;s office. They said no champagne for your action, although 
      it&apos;s a very nice compliment to you.&quot; I got on parchment telling me that 
      the action I took to stop the running truck prevented great damage to the 
      engine and the engines standing in the shed, and the injuries for them 
      working was extremely praiseworthy, and would be put on my record. No 50 
      quid. I have the commendation still, but I&apos;d sooner have the 50 quid!</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Worked on the Cockburn from 1911 to 1916. In 1914, the 
      World War started. By the way, we were not long at Pt Pirie, when Edie 
      remarked &quot;I would not be surprised to see Clarrie come here&quot;, and it was 
      not long before Clarrie tossed up his job and came. Quiet old stick,
      Clarrie. The only remark he made [was], &quot;I&apos;m here, Edie.&quot; He remained and 
      took a job in the Loco as storeman. Clarrie could not keep away from the 
      boys re the War. In 1915, Roy enlisted in the 9<sup>th</sup> Light Horse 
      as a trumpeter and sailed. Clarrie said that someone ought to go to look 
      after him, and he enlisted. He tried to get into the Light horse but 
      failed to pass so he went into the Infantry. When Clarrie went, Jack and 
      Dick enlisted. Roy came back, but Clarrie, Jack and Dick got killed within 
      a fortnight, Clarrie and Dick in France and Jack at sea. (See the stories
      of Stephen's brothers at <a href="JAQuintrell.html">JAQuintrell and WW1</a>,

      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The Cockburn road was the best I worked, although it 
      was the hardest. You had your own engine and your own mate. It was along 
      run and long hours. When you left Petersburg, you did not know what would 
      happen. Dust storms, ants, grasshoppers, grubs, washaways, thunder storms 
      – a lot of things happened on the 45 mile run. Ants were a curse on
      Narrabibbi. When they were travelling they would strike the railway lines 
      and then run along them, causing the engine to slip. Also the stench would 
      make you want to vomit. Grasshoppers were nearly as bad. They would come 
      in millions and in the cuttings pulled you up. Grubs migrating were nearly 
      as bad as ants, but you got rid of them quickly. McDonald&apos;s Hill was the 
      worst place for grubs. They were all going one way, and they go as 
      suddenly as they came. Where they end up, goodness knows. Storms and 
      washaways would come up suddenly. I remember one. I left Cockburn after 
      the BH Express left on getting to Marreaba. I saw the express standing 
      there and the Station Master came to me and told me to uncouple my engine, 
      and run to the top of Oulina Bar(?) as there was a washaway right at the 
      top. When I got there the gang there was repairing the road, so I had to 
      run the big T Class engine over to see if it could stand the express 
      crossing it. It appears there was a cloudburst and the ballast was washed 
      away from the sleepers at the top of the hill. I left Olary in a big 
      storm. It was a beauty – thunder and lightning and rain. There is a big 
      hill between Olary and Oulina – a lot of iron ore chiefly – and the hill 
      is scarred with it. The water was coming down in waves. The culverts were 
      shallow. I got through but it was days before any of the others.</font> </p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">At that time, all along the road, you passed people 
      going along tramping it for Broken Hill, or &apos;jumping the rattler&apos; in the 
      open trucks. We did not take nay notice of them. Ben Cotton, signalman at 
      Oatalpa saw 5 or 6 one day riding and ordered them out. I told him that he 
      would be sorry, and he told me afterwards that he was, for they killed 
      some of his goats to eat, and he had to feed them. He never put any 
      &quot;rattlers&quot; off after that. Cockburn was a home from home. I slept in the 
      old Barracks, and the new Barracks were splendid and comfortable. The 
      bedrooms [were in] a two-story building with rooms both sides. Lavatories 
      and washrooms away from the bedrooms and Dining Room. A big roomy place 
      off the Dining Room; kitchen with two big ranges, and two sitting rooms, 
      one for the smokers and the other for Nons.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">I was on the Cockburn Road from 1911 to 1916. There 
      were fine fellows on that were always willing to help one another, and 
      fine enginemen, willing to learn their job for that road. If you had a 
      breakdown, you had to manage, and they would always stop and help, for you 
      could not send for a fitter, and many a time you would come to your 
      journey&apos;s end working with one side. We had the advantage of having a 
      splendid teacher in Engineman Harry Pearce on Engine and the Westinghouse 
      Brake. He would repeat and show you over and over again until you 
      satisfied him. Very patient. No wonder the Cockburn men were so efficient. 
      When you came up for your certificate on both Engine and Westinghouse and 
      train handling, very seldom anyone failed. Also all road men were 
      certificate Ambulance men, and the men were true mates. Men like Davey 
      Collier, Harry Pearce, Tom Angrave, Jack Russell, Harry Liston, Nazo
      Trueman, Charlie Vine, Billy Woods, Tom Clarkson, Herman Yon, Bill 
      Harding, Jim Mackie, and others -–all good men and good comrades.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">While at Petersburg, my father died. I met him once 
      when he was Inspector of Mines at Marine Hill, and he rode with me to Port

      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">1916 ended my narrow gauge work. I had experience with 
      all classes of engine, both firing and driving on the Narrow Gauge from

      Z Express, Big Wheels, K Shunting, Petersburg T Class.</font></p>

      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">In 1919, myself and George Platten were transferred to 
      Adelaide. I learnt the suburban line with Engineman Stephens, and the 
      South road with Engineman Fred Linfoot, and Victor Harbor line with C
      Everall. From then on I worked South road to Tailem Bend and Karoonda 
      Murraylands line, Mt Pleasant, and Sedan, and North lines. Worked on North 
      as far as Gawler – all suburban lines. Adelaide on Glenelg line, round 
      trips to Victoria Sq and back. Henley Beach and Semaphore and Outer 
      Harbour and Northfield. On Glenelg line we worked P Class engine, standing 
      coal for the trip in the small cab, and from South Tce to Victoria Sq 
      ring. Our Sundays away from home were spent at Murray Bridge, Tailem Bend, 
      Mt Pleasant. I was not long at Mile End before I was sent – knowing all 
      the north – relieving for 6 weeks at Petersburg, Pirie, Pt Augusta and
      Quorn. At Mile End we had several classes of engine to work – R, RX, TX, 
      500, Mountain Type, 600 Pacific, 700 Mikados and P. For the next 20 years 
      I worked all sorts of trains – Freight and Passenger, Express, 
      Commissioner, Royal.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The most expressie(?) train was the first hospital 
      train from Murray Bridge to Adelaide with the first of the wounded 
      soldiers from the First World War. I was appointed the leading engine with 
      Tom Trueman the assisting engine. My engine was 217 and both engines and 
      tenders were decorated by the women of Murray Bridge and Cleaner(?) with 
      coloured garlands from the coppertop to Dome to the Cab and all along th4e 
      side, and the leading engine (217) with a big shield in the front of the 
      smoke box. We had to slow down to 10 miles per hour through all the 
      stations and I&apos;ll never forget us crawling into Adelaide Station and the 
      crowded platforms. Ralph was married in 19—and Norman in 1928.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Another event was in 1929 when I crashed with the 
      East-West Express on Warla Hill, halfway to Callington, owing to the 
      bridge washing away owing to a terrific thunderstorm. The water came from 
      between two hills, washing the ballast away, leaving only the rails and 
      sleepers standing. I have been in and seen storms before but never quite 
      like that one. The Mountain 508 – the &apos;Sir Lancelot Stirling&apos; – rolled 
      over to the right and, striking the stone supports of the bridge, fell 
      over to the right and cantered over, swinging the big tender across the 
      line. The rail came right through the cab just missing my mate Alick 
      Rowberry and the coaches of the train, breaking the couplings and tore the 
      end of them. The corridors being on that side of the train, shedding 
      wheels off into the creek - luckily for the passengers there was no one in 
      the corridors - until it came to the sleeping coaches and the brake. The 
      guard of the train was Fred Gherkins. The first sleeper coach – the 
      &apos;Baderloo&apos; – fell over afterwards. We got the people out and she fell over 
      afterwards. There were water all round the engine. There was a few 
      casualties, none seriously, a few bruises and shock, and as a whole, they 
      were a splendid lot of passengers. They had no complaints but a lot of 
      thanks. A peculiar thing of this [was that] in the last coach was my old 
      mate Alf Holthouse was riding in the coach next to the brake van. [He was] 
      coming to Adelaide, being a sick man. He was my mate in the accident at 
      Petersburg with Big Bend, and the guards did not realise until afterwards 
      that there had been an accident. There was an inquiry over the affair, but 
      neither Alick or myself was asked to attend. We were there for some hours 
      before the relief train from Adelaide backed up to take the passengers to 
      the city, with myself and Alick in the brake van, which stopped at Mile 
      End Goods to alight, as they did not want us to go into Adelaide. I got 
      home and found the News Photo man and Victoria Reynolds waiting for me, 
      and Edie astonished for they [had] told her that I would not be home until 
      later, as I was working a later train – very considerate of them – and so 
      she should not worry.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The SouthEast passenger [train] came from Murray Bridge 
      and stopped at the back of our train – W Shultz and Fireman Haines the 
      train men - with the Superintendent from Murray Bridge. After the water 
      dropped down, I sent my mate and he got over and went to Callington to 
      report while there. Some men from a Highways camp and brought two big 
      billy cans filled with coffee, which was appreciated. A peculiar thing 
      about it – that morning before we booked, we were having breakfast with 
      the SouthEast crew – W Shultz and B Haines – [and] I said I had a funny 
      dream. I dreamt that we were working a train and fell into a great pool of 
      water, and the engine sank to the bottom. [We] were sitting on the bank 
      when the Head came up and asked how they were going to get the engine up. 
      I said, &quot;That&apos;s easy. Get down and empty the boiler and pump her up with 
      air and she will float up!&quot; The Fireman (Haines) came up off the SouthEast 
      train and said to me, &quot;What about your dream last night? If that was not a 
      premonition!&quot; They had me booked next day – that was a Saturday – but my 
      son Ralph objected, so they crossed me out, but sent me out on the 
      Melbourne Express on the Sunday. That was the last trip I had with Alick 
      as he took ill with <i>[illegible]</i> and went off the road into the 
      sheds.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The road from Nairne to Balyarta was always a hoodoo to 
      me, as also affairs that went wrong always happened to that section. 
      Running down from Nairne to Balyarta with a goods train composed of trucks 
      with a few in front equipped with air and the rest no air, I steadied them 
      down and [had] just released the brake when, coming out of a curve, there 
      was the maintenance gang going to work on a trolley. We tipped them off 
      the road. When I could pull up I went back to see if anyone was injured. I 
      met the boss who told me that everything was alright, only the old boiler 
      they used to have to make their tea was the only thing broken. On reaching 
      Balyarta, I went to the front of the engine and [illegible] to see if 
      [there was] any damage. I found two oilskins and a billy of tea, with tea 
      in it, riding on the bogie axis.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Another time, working a Mikado, I stopped at the 
      Station Yard to cross a train when one of the big tubes in the firebox 
      burst and left me stranded. The hoodoo continued. On the express one day – 
      the Railways Commissioner on board – I went through Callington with a 
      minute to spare. I let her run down to pick her up for the climb to Warla, 
      when she came to a stop. No power! The regulator [had] come uncoupled in 
      the Dome, so no steam could pass through the steam and cylinders. Mr 
      Anderson came up. He said Mr Webb said, &apos;Well, the driver has given us a 
      nice ride so far, and now he has stopped so we may drink our coffee, you 
      better see what&apos;s the matter.&apos; He asked me the reason and also what I was 
      going to do. I told him my mate had gone back to Callington and wired for 
      a Mountain Type or a boostered Mikado. We waited for some time until a 
      Pacific engine came down. I told him, it&apos;s of no use as her load to pull 
      was 350 tons, and she was of no use as I had 426 tons in coaches and the 
      tender [another] 220 tons, so she could never pull up the grade to Warla. 
      He asked what to do, and I told him the Pacific could … <i>[illegible] …
      </i>only pull the dead 500, and told him to wire a heavy engine to get the 
      train. When the Pacific came, we uncouple from the train and [it] pulled 
      us up to Warla. Then he told me to come with him to the telephone box and 
      he not slate them (?). I heard him say, &quot;You, in your wisdom, thought you 
      knew more than the driver, a practical engineman. Now here we are at Warla 
      with the engine. Mr Webb and the Commissioner are still down the bank, and 
      a serious delay again!&quot; He asked me what should be done. I told him, here 
      we are with the dead engine and the Pacific engineman J Temby, and the 
      engine and crew of the Pacific is to work the express from Tailem Bend 
      across the desert to Serviceton. He could tow me to Murray Bridge and take 
      water there, and take her the remainder of the trip. The 500 class, when 
      she came, could go down and pick up the Express and leave me at Murray 
      Bridge to be picked up later. He instructed them to do so.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The hoodoo continued. Sometime afterwards, also on the 
      Express, the same thing happened on going through Balyarta. When I started 
      to pick her up for the rise to Callington the same thing happened, but 
      when she stopped I let her run into the Balyarta yard and telephoned Mile 
      End. There happened to be a Mountain Type engine at Aldgate, with 
      engineman Len Taylor there, so they sent her down to pick me up. After the 
      two mishaps they put a collar over the joints to prevent it [happening 
      again]. While waiting at Balyarta, they had the Dining Car on, and they 
      came to the engine with tea and fish and chips. I told the waiter it was 
      very kind of him, and he said, &quot;That&apos;s alright. They are going to uncouple 
      the Dining Car at Tailem Bend, and there&apos;s a dance on there, so that will 
      suit us.&quot;</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Another one that I can recollect was on the suburban 
      [line]. I left Henley Beach on the morning train and, running into 
      Marlborough St [Station?], I saw a young baby, about 2 years old, playing 
      in the ballast. I did a quick stop with air and reversing steam. This did 
      some damage to the draw gear of the [illegible] and shook up the 
      passengers. I just stopped and I could just see the child over the 
      buffers. I got down and took the child to the lady caretaker. </font> <i><font face="Arial">[the next 
      page/s are missing]. …..</font></p>
      </i>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">I had 12 hours to finish my time, so they put me on the 
      10.25 am to Bridgewater with the Centenary Train - train and coaches green 
      and gold – and on Tuesday, with four hours to make, they sent me on the 
      &apos;Dolly Grey&apos; to Adelaide. Put me on one of the sidings, and left me there 
      with nothing to do until 12 noon, and then sent me to Loco. I had a proper 
      Railwayman&apos;s sendoff. I started for Mile End, and we pulled up at the Goal
      curvey(?), when the signalman, an old mate, Arch Templer, and the carriage 
      shunters said &quot;Good-bye&quot;. At Mile End Cabin, they closed the gates on me, 
      and signalmen Schoff and W Virgin said their good-bye. On arrival at the 
      sheds, the foreman Talbot came to me on the pit and I asked to send 
      someone to stable the engine. He said, &quot;No. Examine the engine and book 
      your repairs, and make the engineman&apos;s sheet out, and then come with me.&quot; 
      He took me to the big Dining Room. It was lunch hour, and there were 
      speeches from the fitters. One said that some enginemen, when their engine 
      is not going too well, report their steam chest valves for examination too 
      often, but when engineman [Quintrell] reported the valves, I never found 
      him wrong. They presented me with a beautiful gold watch, &quot;Star Dennison&quot;, 
      and pipe and accessories. The Commissioner of Railways said it was a 
      mistake, this age of men. &quot;Good men reaching the age limit like engineman
      Quintrell, who is good enough for another 5 years, but it is the law, and 
      even I have to retire when I reach it.&quot; While there a telegram came from 
      Brisbane from an old Cockburn road man, Jimmy Steadman. It said &quot;Goodbye 
      Steve – one of the old brigade&quot;. So that was the end of my working days 
      and, with the words of Adam Lindsay Gordon&apos;s &apos;The Sick Stockrider&apos;, I can 
      say</font></p>

      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> <font face="Arial"> I started off thinking of the Good Times ahead of 
      me, but it was not to be for my dear Edie started ailing, and lingered for 
      2 years&apos; suffering. There was hope for her getting better, but she died at 
      Calvary Hospital and was buried on my birthday. [This] was the saddest 
      time of my life, after being married for 42 years. She was buried with her 
      mother in West Terrace Cemetery. My home was broken up, and I went to live 
      at Walsall St, Kensington Park for 12 months.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">In 1939, I went to Melbourne and stopped at Kew with 
      Edie&apos;s sister Topsy for several months. When Roy went to live in Ruthven 
      Mansions, I migrated to Kingston in the South East from 1939 to 1944 and 
      boarded with the Hayes family at the Coffee(?). World War Two started in 
      1939 and Norman went into the Air Force, Roy in the Military at Keswick 
      Barracks, and myself spotting for aircraft at Kingston. The Hayes family 
      made me feel at home. They were a lovely family and I was quite happy 
      there, for I seemed to be nearer Edie, as the happiest time I ever spent 
      was there.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Kingston is not what you would call a pretty place. It 
      is a place where time seems to stand still. I could wander about looking 
      backward to the past. There was the house that Roy was born in, a fairly 
      comfortable place named &apos;Kulkyne&apos;, owned by the Abbotts who kept the 
      store. The hotels [were[ the Royal Mail, kept by W Pinches; the Crown, 
      kept by Arthur, Doris and G Wilson; the Kingston Arms, kept by T Newson 
      and J Collins (now Hayes Coffee Place). [There was] the old engine shed 
      where I spent many lonely nights, and the fishing boats – Volunteer, 
      Mavis, Royal, Petrel, Jennifer, Annie, … <i>[illegible].</i> I had plenty 
      of enjoyment going out in the fishing boats for crays with Walter Blackler 
      in the motor dinghy off the point for picking, and fishing off the jetty 
      for mullet, yellowtail, silver whiting, flathead and garfish at Kingston 
      or Port Caroline on Lacepede Bay. [The bay] is very weedy and a good 
      feeding ground for fish. Plenty of sharks – white pointers, grey nurse, 
      hammerhead, whip, and sweet william – I have seen there as at Port 
      Caroline the whole sweep of the Southern Ocean right from the Antarctic 
      rolls in there. I have seen seals [and] sea lions [and] also albatross 
      come in there. They were good chaps the fishermen of Lacepede Bay – Jimmy 
      Forbes and his brother Bill of the &apos;Mavis&apos;; the Blackler brothers of the 
      &apos;Petrel&apos;; Wag Winter, Dallisons of the &apos;Annie&apos;. Ned Barber [also] sailed 
      out with them.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">While living with the Hayes, every first Tuesday in the 
      month, I used to go with Walter Smith skin buying in his big lorry. He 
      bought skins in a big way and always carried with him big money. He also 
      wanted a companion he could trust. We would start from Kingston and visit 
      all the rabbit camps and stations from Kingston and the Coorong, going 
      through to White Hut, Dalkeith, then across to Tillies Swamp (?), Tatiara, 
      Salt Creek, Policeman&apos;s Point, Woods&apos; Well, McGrath Flat to Meningie the 
      first day, stopping at Meningie at the hotel, Walter paying all the 
      expenses. The next day to the Tatiara Station, Ashfield, Potalick, across 
      the punt to the Point McLeay Mission Station, Narung to Campbell House and 
      back to Meningie. The next day we did the township and loaded up and left 
      Meningie after midnight, and through the Coorong back to Kingston.</font> </p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">I did plenty of fishing off the jetty, and one day I 
      caught a lovely fish, and looked through Bill Hagget&apos;s Fishery Book. It 
      was a Sea Robin and very rare. I used to spend off weeks at Cape Jaffa 
      with Jim and Bill Forbes going out to the reefs, cray fishing around the 
      rocks. I liked it very much down there – a fine hut and plenty of company. 
      There were five boats there – Forbes, Len Goldsmith, Jeff Harrington, 
      Frank Winter, Vin and Yacka Backler – and plenty of snakes!. A lot of 
      people come to Cape Jaffa for the fishing, people like the Tolleys of 
      whisky fame, Archie Holmes and Ben Matson and his two son-in-laws – not 
      forgetting Blackie and Dave Pannell. We used to play Nap of a night among 
      ourselves; we had two beer mugs full of pennies.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">We fed well there. I used to love them smoked. When we 
      pulled up the pots out on the reef by the lighthouse, you often found fish 
      in them and octopus. We had a bar across the top of the chimney and we 
      used to hang the fish there with a barrow load of sheoak and current (?) 
      wood chips and smoke them a nice golden brown, leaving them there all 
      night, and for breakfast, in the frying pan with sea water, they were 
      delicious.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">I also took on wattle bark stripping. The agents gave 
      five pounds ten shillings a ton – a big price – so old Harry Cooper and I 
      took it. Harry was a grand old chap; he was 75 and I was 72, two quite 
      young fellows! Harry had good bush implements - a fine bush tent and 
      flies, and all the tools – so we went to Noolook, made our camp in a big 
      SiAli (?) bush. These SiAli trees grow immense. One tree will start, and 
      then as time goes on it throws out branches, and when they touch the 
      ground they root like a Banyard tree. The wattles grow very thick around
      Wangolina, and we made good money. We could get a ton a week, and it was a 
      great experience for me. We had a cosy camp, and Mr Hayes would send out 
      by the mailman to Robe plenty of food, and come out now and then to bring 
      us in on Saturdays. I thoroughly enjoyed being out there: you could sleep 
      well and eat well. Harry was a great old bushman and good company. It was 
      great out there. In the morning you would wake up by the birds: first one 
      would start, then another, and all the birds in the wattles would begin 
      their morning song. And then at evening time, the birds would be giving 
      you a grand chorus before going to roost. First the wattle birds would 
      begin, then the rest would join in. The last one to chime in, just as 
      darkness et in [was] the ugly old Mopoke, with his dolorous &quot;Mo-poke&quot;.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The wattle company is a great feeding ground for birds: 
      wattle birds, paratoos, ringnecks, green linnet, black cockatoos, white 
      cockatoos, king parrots, grass parrots, redcaps, rosellas, bronze wing 
      pigeons, the ugly old Jaybird, and the lovely and friendly blue bonnets. 
      You could also hear from the swamp close by music from the swans and 
      ducks. There were a lot of emus, kangaroos, foxes, and wombats; and the 
      creeping lizards and brown and tiger snakes – a great lot of them. You had 
      to keep a good lookout for them. [There were] also prowling dogs. One day 
      the beggars found our camp and ate us out of house and home, even eating 
      the fat in the frying pan. To keep our eggs we had to dig a hole in the 
      sandy floor of our tent, but when we came to get them, they were gone. We 
      were blaming the snakes as the robbers. On leaving our tent for work, 
      Harry used to smooth the floor with a rake in case of snakes. If there 
      were any you would see their tracks. One day we were resting and smoking 
      on our beds [when] I saw a big sleepy lizard come in. I watched and he 
      went straight to our egg safe. I called Harry'&apos; attention to him and said, 
      &quot;There&apos;s our robber!&quot; We caught him and gave him a dose of FlyTox stuff. 
      We were never troubled afterwards with him. Another time I felt something 
      biting me all night and, on leaving the camp, I felt the biting again. I 
      pulled up my shirt and a great green centipede dropped out. You could see 
      the marks of his bites around my waist. I got the wind up, but old Harry 
      said it was alright, they don&apos;t hurt you. I was a bit sceptical, but 
      nothing happened. Anyhow, we made 30 pounds each, and I earned a trip to 
      Adelaide.</font> </p>

      the Palace. A nice happy lot of boarders – Toby Sanderson, Ron Morris, 
      Dick Hunt, Louie McKenna – playing penny poker and telling … <i>
      [illegible].</i> Four years were spent happily there. There was always 
      something you could do – fishing; duck shooting; strolling around the 
      swamps to see the swans and ducks, also those strange birds, the drongos, 
      doing their dances; and fox shooting and plenty of sports. That&apos;s why I 
      like the SouthEast.</font> </p>

      kinfolk again, and I came back to the city and lived with Nell and Bill 
      Long and, in 1948, came to live with Olive and Norman at Byron Rd, Black 
      Forest. Then Norman built at the foot of the range at &apos;Windemont&apos;. I like 
      it there very much; a glorious view of the city. Then afterwards here at 
      80 Richmond Rd, Westbourne Park. While at Windemont, a stray dog [whom we 
      called] Larry came and stopped, and now he is my constant companion – a 
      great pet. While here, Bob and his Canadian wife came for a 12-month 
      visit. They are now back in Canada, and have a new addition to their 
      family, a great-granddaughter, Stacey.</font></p>

      willing, but the flesh is weak&quot;. Still, I am lucky, though now in my 87<sup>th</sup>

      into notice was when he was In a cattle truck with other dog shipped to 
      the far North to Cattle Stations. The guard of the train ferry took a 
      fancy to him, and after that he took him in the brake van. Bob liked 
      travelling and always followed him to work, and rode in the van, until one 
      day he took to riding in the engine. He was always, like his fellow 
      &apos;enginemen&apos;, liking the open spaces. He was the only dog allowed, although 
      one Commissioner forbade it, but the men made such an opposition to it, he 
      rescinded his motion, but no other dog was to be allowed in future. So Bob 
      continued on his merry way and travelled widely to Melbourne, Sydney and 
      as far as Brisbane. At the completion of every trip, he always followed 
      the engineman home, and was an important visitor. When back in Adelaide, 
      he always went for a feed at the eagle Hotel and the girls always gave him 
      the best. Every traveller knew Railway Bob, and the children adored him.

      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">He was lost for a time – someone pinched him. But one 
      day he brought him to a station, herding sheep. Bob heard the engine 
      whistle and ran to the engine, and the crew were glad to see him. The man 
      followed him and claimed him, but he made a big mistake, for on the engine 
      was Herman You, and he found it a losing proposition. He reckoned he would 
      go to law, but was told that the dog was the property of the Railways and 
      he would be sued for stealing him. Bob got killed by a butcher&apos;s cart in 
      Hindley St. He was stuffed by a taxidermist and he can be seen in 
      Tattersalls Hotel.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Among the amusing things I recollect was at Port Pirie. 
      After knocking off after a trip from Petersburg, my mate, Jimmy shrives, 
      and I went down to the Pirie Hotel, and George Coleman said, &quot;We are 
      raffling a nice Christmas Goose at a shilling tomorrow.&quot; I told him we 
      would not be there. George said, &quot;I&apos;ll throw for you.&quot; On our return from 
      our trip, we went down for a drink. Coleman said, &quot;I threw highest for 
      you, Steve, so you had better get your goose. It&apos;s in the loose box, as 
      I&apos;ve seen some of the stewards off the boat looking at it.&quot; So I went to 
      the loose box and looked, and there was a beauty of a goose [so] I grabbed 
      it and took it home. It was heavy. My father came from Moonta to visit us 
      and he had our Christmas Dinner, and Dad complimented me on the lovely 
      goose. That was alright, but a day or two after, I went to Coleman&apos;s pub 
      for a drink, and Coleman said, &quot;Drink it up Steve and get.&quot; I enquired 
      what for, and he told me that Mrs Coleman had it in for me for stealing 
      her goose. Old George told me, &quot;I&apos;ve tried to explain to Ethel, but it was 
      of no use.&quot; It appears that someone stole the goose of mine and Mrs 
      Coleman had to ring … [illegible] … as soon as I could, but she was 
      waiting for me. &quot;So you stole my goose!&quot; and she gave me a slap in the 
      face, and then started laughing, so everything in the garden was 
      absolutely lovely.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">While on the goose story, I recollect another one when 
      I was stationed at Bordertown. We went to live at Green&apos;s place. It was a 
      butcher shop at one time and had a lot of small sheds. Lol Spry of 
      Naracoorte gave me six goose eggs. I saw a big hen sitting on eggs in one 
      of the sheds. So I took the eggs from under her, and put the goose eggs 
      there. As time went on, one Sunday myself and Sandy Marshall were standing 
      at the stock yards, yarning with the publican, when the old hen came 
      proudly across the road escorting goslings. Well, getting towards 
      Christmas these goslings grew to a fine size. King the publican asked me 
      if I would sell them. I agreed and got 5/6 each, and I told him he would 
      have to buy the hen too. He said he did not want the hen as he had plenty 
      of fowls. But I was adamant. I would be no party to [separating] the old 
      hen from her family. Anyhow, he agreed and gave me 2/- for the hen. I 
      started to laugh, and he asked me what was the matter? I pushed the 2/- 
      back to him and told him I could not take it as it was his hen! He roared 
      a bit and said to me, &quot;You know what you have done? I sent to town to 
      Padman Brothers for a setting of White Leghorn eggs and paid 25/- for 
      them, and you had the front of using my hen!&apos; Anyhow, he said, &quot;The joke&apos;s 
      on me, but the 25/- I gave you for the geese – you&apos;ve had the trouble of 
      feeding them, so now I reckon we are quits, for geese are double the price 
      now to what I paid you!&quot; All&apos;s well that ends well.</font></p>

      my mind the house I was born in. It is still standing with its villa 
      front, a fine house for those times. In those far-off days, Moonta Mines 
      was at its peak for copper was at its highest price, for at that time 
      telegraph and telephones were in their infancy, and all wooden ships had 
      their bottoms sheaved (sic) with copper. Moonta Mines was noted for 
      richness and plenty in accordance with Wallaroo Mines, but the advantage 
      of the above was soon lost by the productions of other alloys and the 
      discovery in the Argentine, South America and other lands, so the high 
      prices tumbled down to a low ebb. I can still hear the tones of the 
      clapper at the Pits Head for the rise and fall of the buckets hauling and 
      discharging the ore. Other memories of those days [are] the singing of 
      those dear old Cornish voices at the churches and after[wards] the young 
      people walking up and down the road from the Mines to the township was 
      rich and lovely; the blending of those young voices for Moonta was, in 
      those days, noted for its choir and singers.</font> </p>

      scholars in the infant class under Miss Errington. Dr Torr was the 
      principal. One of my earliest recollections was our first removal to 
      Adelaide in 1875. We lives at Barton Tce, North Adelaide while my father 
      was employed in the Government Service. I was only five years old at the 
      time. We did not live in Adelaide very long but went back to Moonta Mines

      from Kadina named Reuben Cox, through Port Wakefield – where I saw a 
      railway engine for the first time – through Wild Horse Plains, Inkerman, 
      Dublin and then to Adelaide to live at Toronto St, Ovingham. I went to

      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">In 1888, I travelled to Port Augusta and stopped at the 
      Junction Hotel, and travelled next day by the mail buggy to take up my 
      duty at the survey camp at Yadlamalka along the east side of the Flinders 
      Range towards Worrokimbo Marachowie Station. Our next camp was to Mt Eyre, 
      a deserted township on the old overland route to the Territory. On our 
      completion of work there, we shifted to the eats side of the ranges. At 
      Stirling North we camped for a couple of days to rest the horses. I went 
      into Port Augusta with Mr Mills and stayed at the Flinders Hotel. We left 
      there with the spring cart and tandem pair, Bantam and Bolivar, and went 
      through the PitchiRichi Pass to Quorn and caught [up] with the rest of the 
      party and then went to Tee Ti Va Spring at the mouth of the Depot Creek 
      Gorge. Depot Creek Gorge runs through the range from the east side to the 
      west side, a very picturesque chain of very deep pools of water – very 
      cold and a great spot for the euros and rock wallabies and dingoes.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Our work there was surveying along the ranges. While 
      there we were invited to a party at Ardenvale, the population chiefly of 
      German settlers. I had my first sleep in a German bed - feather mattress 
      under you and a thick German quilt full of feathers, very nice, warm and 
      comfortable. I climbed to the top of Mt Arden and rebuilt the Trig of 
      stone. The view from the top of Mt Arden was a glorious one, looking over 
      the saltbush plains to the West across Yadlamalka to the Tent Hills of 
      Nonning on the west side of Spencer Gulf. To the south [was] Mt Brown, and 
      the Pass to the east to Mt Ragless, to the pocket to the north where lay 
      the stations of Worrokimbo and Marachowie and Mt Eyre, and away in the 
      distance Mt Desolation. At that time the salt plains abounded with 
      kangaroos – the big red jokers - and the ranges [were] thick with euros 
      and rock wallabies, not forgetting the dingoes and wild dogs and the 
      birds, the crow dominating. So there was plenty of sport for the rifle, 
      and good money for skins.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">After finishing our work there, we travelled through 
      the Hookina Pass to Mern Merna Creek for camping. Mern Merna Creek comes 
      from the Wilpena Pound which lays back behind St Mary&apos;s Peak and Mt Alex. 
      While there, the creek came down a banker owing to heavy rains back of the 
      range. Also some splendid quandongs were ripe, and Sturt Pea blooming. 
      {When] finished there, we travelled north over the Brachina and Bunyeroo 
      Creeks to Parachilna, and camped at the Breakfastime Dam and surveyed the 
      country to old Wilpena Station, and as far as Breakfastime Creek. [We 
      then] broke camp and went to the well at the mouth of the Oratunga Gorge. 
      I may say, while camped at the above places, a very severe drought was on 
      that year (1888), and it was a pitiful sight to see the poor sheep bogged 
      in the mud of the drying dams and the crows (the black blaggards) picking 
      the poor things&apos; eyes out. [The] only thing you could do was to shoot 
      them. Also kangaroos, euros, wallabies, and wild donkeys all round the 
      camp, smelling the water in our galvanised tank which held our drinking 
      water for ourselves and horses.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">While camped at the mouth of the gorge, we went to 
      Blinman for a cricket match, and won it. Our team was made up of three 
      from our own camp, Cosagee and Hildoo from Bob Calwell&apos;s camp, and the 
      rest from D&apos;Alles(?) road gang. Cosagee was our star batsman, a great 
      cricketer. He had been a member of the Bombay Cricket Team that had played 
      in England. I recollect the Blinman Hotel where they gave us a fine dinner 
      of kangaroo tail soup and quandong pudding. The hotel was kept by 
      Remington Barnes who afterwards won a Birthday Cup with a horse called
      Shootover. Incidentally, once while working a passenger train to Karoonda, 
      my mate Jack Maher and I went over to the hotel for a drink [and] looking 
      up saw the licensee&apos;s name over the door, &apos;Remington Barnes&apos;, and on 
      entering the bar saw a picture of Shootover. I made the remark, &quot;Remington 
      Barnes. That sounds like Blinman.&quot; The old gentleman standing behind the 
      bar remarked, &quot;I&apos;m Remington Barnes, and that was my horse,
      Shootover.&quot; 
      Then we entered into conversation, and we could have had the pub.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">After finishing our work there, we had orders to bring 
      the camp to the Survey Yards at Adelaide. The Oratunga Gorge runs through 
      the range to the Blinman and in it is the famous Red Ochre Gorge, a paint 
      that the old time niggers travelled from 100 miles around to get the red 
      ochre to paint themselves for their corroborees. The track down to 
      Adelaide was uneventful. It took us a week or so. We travelled through 
      Craddock, Mananarie, Red Hill, Yalina, Terowie, Black Spa(?), Kapunda, 
      Sheoak Log to the Survey Yards, and disbanded. I still remember the names 
      of our party: Mr W W Mills, surveyor; Jack Fotheringham and myself as 
      chainmen; H Edlen, teamster; Newt Gregory, cook; and Sam Moore as axeman. </font>

      Plains, and then with J T Furner on the pipeline survey – Crystal Brook 
      through Red Hill, Collinsfield, Lochiel, Buntunga over Barunga Gap down to
      Bute. My last trip on the survey was with father on the deep drainage 
      survey of Eastwood, Parkside, Unley and Wayville, so you can see that I 
      had a very busy time for about 6 years. I was then in my 20<sup>th</sup>

      Diamond Drilling at Willochra, where we struck a good supply of water, 
      then transferred the plant to Richmond Valley on the Forest Reserve at the 
      foot of Mt Brown, and stopped there until the finish. While there we 
      visited Quorn often on a Saturday, playing football, and ambled around the 
      rim between the camp, overlooking the Pass, with the Devil&apos;s Punchbowl 
      standing up in the middle of the Pass to the Dutchman&apos;s Stern near Depot 
      Creek. You had to go about carefully on account of snakes as the place was 
      alive with them – carpet snakes, tiger snakes and the deadly death adder. 
      I remember, while camped at Richmond Valley, the mice plague. They came in 
      countless numbers and then the snakes had a wonderful season. Our beds 
      were made from chaff bags, and we became quite used to feeling them under 
      us, but [we] were careful to see the tent was free from snakes before we 
      turned in. The members of our party were Jack Anderson, boss; myself, 
      engine driver; Bill Caroline, driller; G Mallin and Henderson, cook.

      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Railways</font></p>
      </u>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">I joined the South Australian Railways in March 1891 
      and was stationed first at Islington, not thinking that for the next 46 
      years I would end up as an engineman. I did not stop long at Islington, 
      and it was all night work – 6 pm to 6 am – for 4/6 a day. Then I went 
      rambling over the country once more, and I was transferred to Petersburg 
      (now Peterborough). I was then sent on to Cockburn on the border of South 
      Australia and New South Wales. There I struck another year of drought. 
      This time it was rabbits dying of thirst everywhere, taking its toll of 
      Typhoid Fever. It was a hard life, dust storms and everything that was 
      hard. We had to live in tents with a stove in the open air to do our 
      cooking. Our washing a kero tin bucket, a cake of Velvet or Sunshine soap, 
      our clothesline the border fence. It was very trying to find out in the 
      morning that a dust storm had come up and our clothes [were] strewn all 
      around the country. But in all of it, we enjoyed ourselves in a way with 
      yarning, singing and telling of anecdotes and joking – of which I was one 
      of the sufferers ([which] I will relate at the end of my journey).</font> </p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">After a few months at Cockburn, I was stationed at 
      Broken Hill. Broken Hill in those days was wild and woolly, a real 
      cosmopolitan town and a mixed town of the lost 7 tribes of Israel – 
      Greeks, Turks, Cousin Jacks, and all the breeds in the world – and you had 
      to be careful of what you said and did. While at Broken Hill I had my 21<sup>st</sup> 
      birthday, and had attained my manhood, getting 6/6 a day. While at Broken 
      Hill I had my first trip as Fireman with driver Eustace Bayliss on the 
      express Broken Hill to Cockburn on a Yankee Engine No 48. Also [I had] 
      several trips on a Sunday to the Rat Hole, a well at Umberumbeca, with the 
      water train as Broken Hill had a water famine. Stephens Creek, their main 
      water supply had dried up. We filled the travelling tanks and emptied them 
      at Sulphide St into troughs where the populace bought it by the bucket. 
      Clothing as very cheap as NSW was free trade and SA was protection. You 
      could buy a shirt for 1/- to 3/-, wear it Sundays and then the weekdays, 
      then burn it, as washing would cost you 3/6 on account of the water 
      famine.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">While at Broken Hill the big strike started in 1892. 
      Sleath and Ferguson were the leaders and got gaol terms, and everything 
      was at a standstill, and we were taken away and sent to different 
      stations. I was lucky, being sent to the SouthEast. They took me off at 
      Naracoorte and sent the others on to Mt Gambier – they were Jack Sharpe 
      and Harry Liston. I was kept at Naracoorte and, after a while, transferred 
      to Bordertown. While there, I sustained a broken foot while turning a 
      narrow gauge engine on the turntable. The turntable had a third rail 
      between the two rails of the broad gauge, and I was tricked, getting my 
      foot caught by the third rail and that put me aside for several months. On 
      my return to work, I started again at Naracoorte, doing light duties in 
      the shed for a while, and then went on the road between Naracoorte, Mt 
      Gambier, Kingston and Bordertown. It was there, as the old song says, &apos;I 
      met me doom&apos;. I courted and married Miss Edie Long and then started 
      another life.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">While in the shed at Naracoorte, Mr Grurbach (?) the 
      foreman taught me the setting of engine valves and that stood me in good 
      stead in after years, as when they gave me my send-off on my retirement. 
      The valve fitter at Mile End [said] that, when engineman Quintrell booked 
      the valves to examine for re-setting and other faults, he knew what he was 
      booking, and I would get to them immediately and found that he was always 
      right.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">In 1894, I joined the Masonic Lodge at
      Naracoorte, and 
      in that Lodge, I went through all my degrees, and now, at the present 
      time, I have been a Mason for 60 years. I was transferred to Kingston, and 
      Roy was born there on 13<sup>th</sup> November 1894, and I was a proud 
      father. Kingston has always had a charm for me, for my happiest times were 
      spent there by the sea, fishing [from] jetty and boat, and gathering rare 
      shells on the beach. [There was] cricket and football and I was captain of 
      both. At Naracoorte, Ralph was born – November 7<sup>th</sup>, 1898, and 
      also Norman, 1902.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">While stationed at Kingston, 1897, we had severe 
      earthquake shocks which continued for several months. Also a tidal wave 
      came and piled up the foreshore with seaweed. [It was] 30 feet high and 
      nearly reached the road – very lucky for Kingston it did not. Before the 
      shock, Kingston had a nice beach, but now there is no beach for a mile 
      each side of the jetty, and it has caused the land to encroach onto the 
      sea for several yards. The shocks were supposed to arise from a submarine 
      volcano off Cape Jaffa. While at Kingston (1900), the Boer War started and 
      the Bushmen&apos;s contingent went to the Transvaal. Also the Protection 
      Gunboat went to China [for the] Boxer Rebellion. One of the crew was 
      Charlie DeLongville from Kingston.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">My mate at Kingston was Charlie Hall, (long since 
      dead), [and] guards T Ryan, George Elsey and Charlie Gust. I was then 
      transferred back to Naracoorte and there had my first trip as an 
      engineman, Naracoorte to Wolsely and back, my mate being Bert Rumball, on 
      an Engine W Class 56. In 1903, I was transferred to Mt Gambier. Times were 
      very bad – a Depression. A lot of us [were] re-graded and I was one of the 
      unlucky ones – to a cleaner again at 6/6 a day. As a fireman, I received 
      8/- a day. I was discontented with my position and wanted my right share 
      of firing, as junior men to me up north were doing superior work, [so I] 
      put in my application for Port Pirie, and got it, so I was back up north 
      again. While at Mt Gambier I saw the opening of a tower at the top of the 
      mount.</font></p>

      ships, with the train running down the street. I was stationed at Port 
      Pirie for 7 years and in 1911, I was sent on to Petersburg to take my 
      place as an engineman. At Pirie, we made many good friends – the Dalys, 
      Helliers and Milnes – and the friendships last until now.</font></p>

      13 home at Petersburg. It was a hard road and we had many different, 
      difficult jobs to contend with – dust storms, grasshoppers, grubs and 
      ants, washaways and wind, but it was &apos;all in a day&apos;s work&apos;. While at 
      Petersburg, World War 1 started in 1914, and Roy went to Palestine with 
      the 9<sup>th</sup> Light Horse. Also, my only brothers – Clarrie, Jack and 
      Dick –[went]. Roy returned at the Armistice after 5 years in the desert, 
      but my brothers remained behind, two buried in Flanders (Clarrie and Dick) 
      and Jack at sea.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">In 1916 I was transferred to Mile End and remained

      North, Victor Harbor, Mt Pleasant, Sedan and Willunga lines, passenger, 
      freight and express, until my retirement. I had many experiences, some 
      I&apos;ll relate at the end of my task. I have fired and driven many classes of

      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">An old school mate of mine, Bob Abrahams, was station 
      master here (Cockburn) and when he heard he had an inspiration. The
      Chargeman, Ned Boscene, bought a violin and wanted to learn to play it. 
      The Quintrell family of Bellringers had just made a tour of the North and 
      Broken Hill, so Bob had a conversation with Bozzy, and told him that I was 
      one of them and a fine violin player, and he ought to get a few lessons 
      from me, but not to take any notice [for] I may make out that I could not 
      play it. Anyhow, when I arrived there, they told me about the joke and 
      left me to it. Bozzy collared me immediately I arrived to give him a few 
      lessons, and nothing I could say about not being able to play it would 
      convince him. I stalled for a time and then promised to give him lessons. 
      [I] had a job to put him off but one day I went to my slaughter. In 
      passing his tent, he called me in and put the violin in my hands. I 
      fiddled around with it until I broke a string and then told him I was 
      sorry, but the violin was no good and I didn&apos;t like a second hand fiddle. 
      He took it quietly until I got up to go away and, at the door, helped me 
      along with his foot. That made me very angry. He was a big burly Cousin 
      Jack, and I had no hope of tackling him, so I gathered a heap of stones – 
      of which there was plenty of them – and bombarded him every time he tried 
      to come out. It was a shame to what he would do to me when he got me. Mr 
      Hill came along and asked what I was up to, so I told him, and as he knew 
      of the joke, all I got from him was that I deserved it for keeping up the 
      joke and humiliating Boscance. So I raised the siege, and we were good 
      pals afterwards but my reputation as a musician was blasted.</font></p>

      so any known criminals had little hope of getting away unobserved. I saw a 
      fine looking woman, dressed lovely. The detective standing by the engine 
      said to me, &quot;She looks nice, don&apos;t she? Well, she won&apos;t get far. She is 
      one of the biggest procurers in Australia&quot;.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Once on the Cockburn road my mate … <i>[illegible].</i> 
      It was a bitter cold night for a young kangaroo and he wanted to take it 
      home. We put it in a bag at the back of the … <i>[illegible].</i> I went 
      to see how our young passenger was, but he was frozen stiff. We got him 
      down to the firebox to warm him up, but he kicked the bucket. So when we 
      got to Mannlill, the signalman was down at the long road to let a train. 
      There was a fire in the waiting room, so we put him in a chair and sat him 
      up and left him – a great mystery, how the kangaroo got there, and to this 
      day, I do not know what he died of – heart failure, or fright, or 
      exposure.</font></p>
