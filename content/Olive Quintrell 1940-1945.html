  at me with wide-open eyes. I got up, dished out the evening meal that Mum had
  cooked and put it down in front of him. We ate in silence, Neil's eyes never
  leaving my face. When we had finished, I cleared the table, washed the dishes,
  and left them to drain. I took Neil to the bedroom, and we both undressed for
  bed. I could just hear the sound of voices from my parents’ bedroom. My
  father seemed to be doing most of the talking, and I could not hear my
  mother's replies. I put Neil to bed, and then climbed into my own. It was
  early for sleep, but I didn't know what else to do.<o:p>

  </font></span><font face="Arial">For many nights, I had heard my parents
  talking in the kitchen late at night when I was supposed to be asleep. Again
  and again, my mother would say, ‘But why, Norman, why?’. My father's reply
  was inaudible, but he spoke for what seemed a long time. Then there were
  silences, and I thought that they had stopped talking, but then they began
  again. Sometimes, I fell asleep and when I awoke the voices were still
  wrestling. In the mornings, my mother was sometimes silent and spoke to none
  of us, and sometimes was very attentive to my father, getting him a second cup
  of tea and touching his shoulder as she gave it to him. His eyes had become
  sad and hollow, but his jaw was hard. He still spoke to us tenderly,
  especially Neil whom he would take on his knee while he drank his tea. My
  brother would sit quietly, looking up at his face, sometimes touching it as if
  to enquire, in his three-year-old way, about the hurt in Dad’s eyes.<o:p>

  tried to understand what it would mean for us if Dad went to the war. The war,
  which had shaken and broken the other side of the world, had reached down to
  touch us, and our safe world was beginning to break apart. Singapore had
  fallen, and we were learning about air-raid precautions, and hating the Nips
  and the Jerries. My father had spent the previous weekend digging an air-raid
  shelter in the backyard of our house, and Mum had made blackout curtains for
  our windows. If my father went to fight the Japs, who would be here to protect
  us? I remembered that Gramp’s brothers had died in the last war, and I
  shivered to think what might happen if my Dad never came home.<o:p>

  </o:p>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent3" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0cm"><font face="Arial">Over
  the next few years, my own awareness of myself and the world into which I had
  been born began to form. Now, only trace memories remain. In one of my
  earliest memories, we are in Melbourne. Norman had been sent to Laverton in
  Victoria to the signals training school and Olive, Bob and I were living with
  Norman’s Aunt Topsy in Kew. It was the Spring and Summer of 1940-41 but I
  only recall darkness and cold. I was just 3 years old, and I was sent to the
  shops on the corner of our street. The corner is quite a busy intersection
  and, although I was probably no more than a few houses from Aunt Topsy’s
  (and Olive was no doubt watching close at hand), I felt that my world had
  suddenly expanded, my life no longer confined by walls and fences. Cars and
  trucks ground down through their gears and accelerated again. I wended my way
  among the legs of adults to the counter and offered up my money, wrapped in
  the shopping list. Women smiled down at me, touched my head and made kindly
  cooing noises.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I had taken my
  first steps out of infancy and found myself reassured by the attention and
  kindness of strangers.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent3"><font face="Arial">In December 1941 Japan
  attacked Pearl Harbour and the next year bombs fell on Darwin and Broome. The
  war was suddenly very close. Norman was posted back to Victor Harbor, and I
  recall standing at Mt Bracken Castle – converted to a training camp for the
  Air Force - overlooking the sea. Bob and a friend are high up in the Norfolk
  Island pine trees and I know I would like to be big enough and brave enough to
  climb up, but I am scared. I call at them to come down, and soon Olive is
  there also calling them down. I am reassured by her presence. I sense Dad at a
  distance.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent3" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="left"><font face="Arial">In
  August of 1943, Norman received a commission as Flight Lieutenant in the Royal
  Australian Air Force and was posted to New Guinea. I began to hear strange
  names mentioned – Lae, Port Moresby, Weewak, Goodenough Island – but
  although my father was absent, the war remained unreal, not touching us in any
  way obvious to a child. I recall Norman digging an air raid shelter in our
  back yard in Byron Road, but going into the shelter seemed like a bit of an
  adventure, not a sign of danger.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent3" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="left"><font face="Arial">Olive
  did not speak a lot of this time of her life so I have to try to reconstruct
  her experience from my own imagination and from the scraps of the unreliable
  memory of a child who was 2 years old when the war began and only 8 when it
  finished.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So what follows is an
  imagined correspondence from Olive to Norman.</font></p>

  Neil seems happy enough, although I’m a bit worried about his cough. It

  was good to get your letter yesterday and to know that we can join you. I’ve
  heard Steve talk about Edie’s sister Topsy, but we’ve never met. Will she
  have room for me and the boys? Bob’s been in a bit of a mood about the idea
  of leaving his friends and he wants to bring his euphonium with him. I’ve
  said we couldn’t get it on the train with all the other suitcases. We had
  words and I sent him to his room and he’s sulking at the moment. Neil’s
  cough seems to have cleared up with the warmer weather. I hope Melbourne’s
  not too damp for him. We had a little party for his third birthday. I wish you
  could have seen his face when we brought in the cake. I’d made it in the
  shape of a plane. I’ll go down to the station to make the train bookings
  after the weekend. Will you be able to get leave very often and be with us at

  don’t fancy having to send Bob off the get Dr Scutt in the middle of the
  night, but if you’re not here I don’t know what else I can do. Dad has
  suggested that Chrissie could come and stay with us for a bit and I might have
  to do that, just to have someone else in the house. I’m feeling a bit wrung
  out. I’m not sleeping too well as I jump up at the slightest sound in case
  it’s Neil. Dr Scutt says I need to have a glass of stout every day to build
  me up. It’s better having you closer, but Victor Harbor might as well be the
  moon when things go wrong. I hope they don’t send you further away …<o:p>

  can be such a trial. She means well, but she’s at Bob all the time about
  something or other. Dr Scutt has given me Parish’s Syrup to try to get my
  energies up and he suggests that I might like to take up smoking to help with
  my nerves, but I don’t much like the idea. And with the rations on
  cigarettes, how would I get them? The boys think the air raid shelter’s a
  bit of a game and I’m trying to keep them out of it and explain that it’s
  quite serious. We all have to collect rags for the war effort and Bob and his
  friends have been having fun dragging a cart around the neighbourhood
  collecting old scrap. They had a bit of a run-in with old Mr Harris who
  didn’t want to hand over anything to them and I had to give Bob a lecture
  about being too cheeky. I wish that you were nearer to keep him in line and I

  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent3" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0cm"><font face="Arial">It
  was hard to hold back the tears as we waved goodbye from the station. The boys
  know that they have to be brave, that it’s ‘all hands to the pumps’ to
  win this wretched war. Everyone sends their prayers. Even your dad, who we
  haven’t heard from for a while – he’s still out in the bush in the
  South-east somewhere - wrote to me to tell me to give you his best wishes and
  to say ‘come back safe’.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My
  Dad came to visit and sat with me for a long time chatting over a cup of tea.
  As you know, he was in the first war. He doesn’t talk much about it, but it
  was good to have him there for comfort. He brought some meat and that’s a
  big help, as the rationing’s getting tighter. We’re being told to use all
  the cheap cuts of the meat, but there’s only so much you can do tripe, and
  the flap of mutton. You have to queue for hours sometimes for the coupons, and
  even then there’s not always enough in the shops to get you through the
  week. Thank goodness for the rabbit-oh. At least we’ll never run out of
  rabbits in Australia! I’m glad we had that week at Bridgewater before you
  left. To have a whole week away was a bit of a luxury. The boys had a good
  time – Bob still gets into Neil a bit about mistaking a lizard for a snake
  and sending them all bolting! …</font></p>

  can’t wait to have you back in Australia again. I know It’s not over, but
  there’s real hope now isn’t there? It’s been such a long haul, but
  things seem to be turning. I’ll be one of the first down the station. The
  boys and I can’t wait …</font></p>

  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent3" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0cm"><font face="Arial">I
  can’t believe that it’s over, and that you’ll be home for good. Bob has
  shot up half a foot and is a young man now. He’s getting quite headstrong
  and needs a father’s guiding hand. Neil’s doing so well at school. You’d
  be proud of him. This year’s been a better one for his asthma, so let’s
  hope that’s on the improve too. We can fill in the air raid shelter –
  I’m so glad we never had to use it – and I want to plant flowers, lots of
  flowers. I’d like to do something I’ve dreamed off for years and start a
  florist business from home. What do you think? Oh, Norman, it will be so good
  to have you home again. Let’s not think about this awful war ever again …<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
