  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="font-size: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Arial">We
  met Norman at the Adelaide railway station. He was dressed in his tropical
  summer-weight uniform with the cap and epaulettes of a Squadron Leader, having
  risen from the rank of corporal through the war. He was leaner than in my
  earlier memories and his skin yellowed from the anti-malarial tablets. He and
  Olive hugged and kissed on the platform. I was unused to seeing such open
  displays of affection from my parents and was confused and slightly
  embarrassed. Bob and I trailed up the platform behind them, their arms about
  each other, oblivious to us.<a title style="mso-footnote-id: ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span style="mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[1]</span></a><o:p>

  </span>A time of planting and flowering began. With pick and shovel, Dad and
  Bob dug up the backyard and formed rows of flower beds that were seeded,
  watered and, with Olive’s care, burst into a riot of colours. The back lobby
  of our Byron Road house became Olive’s workroom and soon the orders for
  flowers for weddings and funerals started to roll in. Partington’s Funeral
  Parlour was on the corner of our street and I was regularly sent to deliver
  wreaths for the funerals. Sometimes I would watch as the funeral director, in
  black coat and top hat, led the funeral procession off down the road, stopping
  the traffic. When the procession had reached its full extension, Mr Partington
  would join the hearse and the sombre procession would proceed at a stately
  pace to the cemetery.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="font-size: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>In late winter, the almond trees, grown now to significant size would
  burst into blossom and, in the Spring the almonds would be harvested, our
  whole family engaged in knocking the almonds, still in their drying husks,
  onto sheets spread on the ground. The shucking of the husks and the cracking
  of the shells was also a family affair, and the almonds provided additional
  income.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="font-size: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>We acquired our first car, a 1928 Wolseley Tourer in which we drove to
  Port Augusta where Olive’s sister lived – Roy, her husband was Postmaster
  - and later to Port Pirie, when Alice and Roy moved there. We visited
  Olive’s father at Alberton, now remarried and with a son, Jack, of Bob’s
  age. In July 1947, Olive’s father died. Fred was a cheerful man and I know
  Olive loved him dearly.<o:p>
  </o:p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="font-size: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Arial">There
  were parties! Rationing was eased within a year of the end of the war, so
  butter, eggs, flour and sugar, in scarce supply throughout my early childhood,
  began to be available. For the first time I began to sample the delights of
  meringues, sponges, decorated biscuits, cream cakes and brandy snaps. Arnie
  performed his magic tricks and introduced games of his own invention. There
  was singing around the pianola and I was allowed to pedal the bellows as
  family and friends sang the hit songs of the day.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="font-size: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>And there were dances! The family could produce its own band; Dad’s
  brother Roy on trumpet or drums, his wife Vi on piano and my cousin Jeff on
  clarinet or saxophone. Olive and Norman would hire a hall and invite family
  and friends to a dance. The women would provide the supper, and Dad would be
  MC. There was the Palais Royal to go to with its spinning glitter ball and its
  big band beating out the tunes of the pre-war swing era – Woody Herman’s
  Golden Wedding, Glen Miller’s American Patrol, Bob Crosby’s March of the
  Bobcats, Artie Shaw’s Begin the Beguine and Benny Goodman’s Stompin’ at
  the Savoy. <o:p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="font-size: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Arial">And
  there was sport! By this time, Bob was making his mark both as a baseballer
  and cricketer. He had won the Pomeroy Cup for the best schoolboy baseballer,
  had made his debut in senior grade baseball at 16 and at cricket a year later.
  He was selected to represent South Australia in baseball in 1949, 1950 and
  1951, and was named in the All-Australian team in 1950. Norman had become
  official scorer for the baseball teams, so Olive was there at every match,
  properly attired as was the custom of the time in coat, hat, and gloves.<o:p>

  </span>The flowerbeds in the backyard gave way to a tennis court and Olive
  went to work at a florist shop in the Central Market. Chrissie was by now a
  permanent fixture, and Norman’s father Steve came to live with us, taking
  over the garage converted to a bedsit. <o:p>

  1950, I started high school. What a difference in Olive’s life between this
  and the time Bob had started high school in 1943. Seven years earlier, Olive
  was bringing up her children with little support from Norman who, before the
  year was out, would be in New Guinea. The Japanese threat was very real, food
  and clothing were rationed, news of the War dominated the news, and Olive was
  thin, anxious and fearful for what the future would bring. Seven years later,
  the world was full of possibilities. Her husband was home, Bob was through the
  turbulence of adolescence, my asthma was now well controlled, a new house was
  under way, and she was developing her own career as a florist. Then, fate
  intervened in a quite different way. <o:p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="font-size: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Arial">Events
  that shape our lives often occur outside our control. The death of her mother
  was a turning point in Olive’s life. The incompetence of banks, businesses
  and governments created economic havoc across the world in 1929 and plunged
  the world into Depression. A German dictator’s mad ambition took her husband
  away for a protracted period in the 40s and gave her some of the most anxious
  periods of her life. In 1950, a chance visit to Adelaide from a Californian
  blonde moved first Bob’s and then all of our lives into new and unplanned
  directions.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="font-size: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>Ron Sharpe, recognised as one of Australia’s best baseballers and
  coach of the Goodwood team for whom Bob played, invited his brother, who lived
  in California, to visit. His daughter, Bebe, accompanied him. Bob was smitten
  and, when Bebe returned to the United States, mooned about, lovesick and
  lovelorn. I remember Olive coming into our bedroom the day after Bebe’s
  departure when we were both still in bed and gently touching Bob on the head.
  ‘Feeling a bit blue?’ she inquired tenderly. Bob’s reply was inaudible.
  She sat on the side of his bed and spoke softly to him. I was not yet 13 and
  had only a vague idea of what the exchange was about, but I remember the quiet
  tenderness and understanding with which our mother addressed her son’s
  heartache.<o:p>
  </o:p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="font-size: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>In 1951, we moved into our new house at Belair Road, West Mitcham built
  on the rise as the Adelaide plains lift into the low hills of the Mt Lofty
  Ranges. Both Chrissie and Steve (“Gramp”) came to live with us. The block
  was large and sloped away from the house. With typical energy and focus,
  Norman and Olive began to plant trees and shrubs and flower beds. I can see
  her on a hot January day, wearing a blue-patterned summer dress with a white
  bodice, watering each plant by hand. Once again, plants grew and flowered for
  her. <o:p>

  </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>In the late 1940s, John
  Ceruto, an American ex-serviceman, came to Adelaide with his family to live.
  Norman was unimpressed with the ‘fast-talking Yank’<a title style="mso-footnote-id: ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><span style="mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[2]</span></a>,
  but he fired Bob’s imagination to try his luck with Major League Baseball in
  the US. Still carrying a torch for Bebe Sharpe, Bob was easily persuaded to
  venture into new territory and so, on October 21<sup>st</sup>, 1951, just a
  day after his 21<sup>st</sup> birthday, Bob sailed from Port Adelaide for the
  United states.<a title style="mso-footnote-id: ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><span style="mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[3]</span></a><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

  <p class="MsoBodyText2"><font face="Arial">In 1955, Olive turned 50 and some
  of the events that had accompanied her birth began to have a major impact on
  the world. Fifty years before, the Wright brothers’ plane had flown 40 km.
  By the end of the fifties, international flights had become a reality. The
  Russian revolutions of 1905 and 1917 now began to change world politics.
  Emboldened by the success of the Communist revolution in China, Communist
  forces from North Korea invaded South Korea, and the United states declared
  war on North Korea. In 1950, Russia became a nuclear power and the ‘arms
  race’ and the ‘space race’ that were to dominate political realities for
  over 30 years had begun. Vladimir Petrov, a Russian diplomat at the Canberra
  embassy, defected, fuelling concerns about Russian spies, and the government
  of Australia attempted to outlaw the Communist party, but was rebuffed by the
  voters. Ho Chi Minh became president of the independent republic of North
  Vietnam. In 1957, we all stood out in the street on a balmy Spring evening to
  watch Sputnik, the first satellite, streak across our sky. King George the
  Sixth of England died, and Queen Elizabeth II was crowned. Norgay Tensing and
  Edmund Hilary became the first to scale Mount Everest.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><font face="Arial">In
  Adelaide, nature offered reminders of its power and our relative impotence to
  control it. In 1953, we awoke to a grinding noise as a rare earthquake shifted
  the ground beneath our feet and cracked the walls of many houses. In early
  January 1955, we sweltered in temperature in the mid-40s as bushfires raged
  across the Adelaide hills. In 1956, the Murray River flooded into South
  Australia and river towns, like Mannum, where we had had summer holidays, were
  inundated. Television, which was to shrink the world even more than
  international plane travel and bring the world into our living rooms, arrived
  in Adelaide.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><font face="Arial">The
  fifties were a time of increasing freedom and contentment for Olive and I
  recall only one incident of discontent – remarkably the only time of
  significant public argument between Olive and Norman I ever witnessed. What
  sparked it I have little idea. It had something to do with a gift Norman had
  bought Olive and was either insufficiently appreciated, or might have been a
  peace offering for some earlier disagreement. Olive had said something with an
  edge in her voice and suddenly, Norman erupted. He shouted at Olive ‘I can
  never get anything bloody well right with you!’ and stormed out of the
  house, slamming the front door forcefully behind him. He started the car and,
  spraying gravel, backed it rapidly of the carport. Bob, who was still at home,
  chased him out the door, yelling at him to come back. Norman returned, his
  face thunderous, and the three of them went into the lounge. Frightened, as I
  had never heard my parents argue like this, I retreated to my bedroom and went
  to bed. Later, my mother came into the room and stroked my head. I looked up
  at her. Her eyes were red from weeping.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </font></span><font face="Arial">‘It’s alright, dear,’ she told me.
  ‘Dad’s just being a bit silly.’</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </font></span><font face="Arial">And that was it. I was not offered any
  explanation then, or since. For years I tried to imagine one. Norman was
  making one of periodic attempts to give up smoking. Had he been particularly
  irritable lately? Olive may have been menopausal. Were there mood changes
  accompanying this hormonal shift? Had there been tension in the bedroom? Had
  Bob been giving them problems? This latter seems unlikely, as he had settled
  into regular work at the ABC<a title style="mso-footnote-id: ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><span style="mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[4]</span></a>
  and his University failures would have been a thing of the past. Recently,
  Charmian recalled a conversation with Olive many years later that may give a
  clue to the matter. One of Norman’s endearing traits – and one I hope I
  have inherited – was his generosity. Olive was more planful and cautious in
  money matters and held the purse-strings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Olive complained that Norman had a habit of putting a deposit on some
  new kitchen appliance, giving to her as a present, and then leaving her to
  finish making the repayments! Maybe this was one occasion too many and Olive
  let fly! This explanation is consistent with both Norman and Olive’s
  characters. Whatever the reasons, this was the one and only time I observed
  acrimonious public dispute between my parents.</font></p>

  <p class="MsoBodyText2"><font face="Arial">On 21<sup>st</sup> October 1951 we
  stood at the wharf at Port Adelaide as the tugs pushed the ‘Orentes’ out
  into the harbour channel, waving to Bob and his cousin Jeff as they left for
  London and their final destination, the United States. Entering the ego-driven
  years of adolescence, I was too immersed in my own sense of abandonment to
  give any thought to my parents’ feelings and, as I try to reconstruct the
  scene, I am again only aware of the lights of the liner retreating into the
  darkness, the chill of the night air around my ears, and my own struggle to
  fight back tears, too self-involved to access any awareness of my parents and
  their concerns.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </font></span><font face="Arial">After Bob left, things went on as normal.
  Sport, family gatherings, dances and parties continued. I moved easily into
  the space formerly occupied by my brother in my parents’ attention. At a
  recent gathering of old baseballers celebrating the beginning of night
  baseball in Adelaide in 1953, many remembered the barbecues at our house at
  West Mitcham. There were parties for the Goodwood baseball club (for whom I
  was now playing), for the Under 17 interstate carnival in Adelaide in 1952<a title style="mso-footnote-id: ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"><span style="mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[6]</span></a>,
  and for visitors in the senior interstate carnival. The piano and pianola was
  always in use, and I was introduced to some of the more risqué songs of the
  time. The baseball fraternity included butchers, greengrocers, and publicans
  so food and beer were plentiful. The baseball wives provided an abundance of
  cakes, sponges and deserts, so a growing boy and his friends found these
  gatherings a cornucopia of food and fun, and an entry in the world of
  adulthood. By now, the smiles were back on Olive’s face and her laughter,
  that from that time forward I associate with her, was heard among the hubbub
  of conversations.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2"><font face="Arial">In October 1953, Olive and Norman
  celebrated their 25<sup>th</sup> wedding anniversary with friends and family
  at our home. All Olive’s brothers and sisters were there, as well as friends
  from their Hampton Road days and May Dickson, her favourite aunt.<a title style="mso-footnote-id: ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"><span style="mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[7]</span></a>
  Even Chrissie, not noted for her high spirits, looked as if she was having a
  good time! As I view the photos, I have a real feeling that Olive and Norman
  have ‘come through’. Whatever the past had dealt them – the Depression,
  the War, problems of readjustment and possible marriage conflict after the
  War, or any of Bob’s adolescent misdemeanours – these were now safely in
  the past. Now, in a new house surrounded by family and friends, they felt
  comfortable and content.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><font face="Arial">Half a
  world away, another courtship was flowering and, soon after this celebration,
  they received a letter announcing the wedding of Bob to Wilma Patricia Burk in
  Vancouver on 9<sup>th</sup> January 1954. Their son and soon-to-be
  daughter-in-law smiled out from the enclosed photo. In December 1954, with the
  birth of Laurence Burk Quintrell, Olive and Norman became grandparents. In
  early 1955, demonstrating my newly acquired drivers’ license, I drove us to
  Parafield Airport to welcome Bob, Trish and Burk to Australia.</font></p>

  <p class="MsoBodyText2"><font face="Arial">Norman and Olive had arranged
  accommodation for Bob and Trish – a small apartment little bigger than our
  current garden flat at Woodburn Ave – and purchased a car for them, a 1928
  Essex Supper Six<a title style="mso-footnote-id: ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8"><span style="mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[8]</span></a>.
  Bob did not find it easy to get consistent work and, with a growing baby, the
  flat soon became too small for Trish and Burk, so they moved in with us at
  Richmond Road, Westbourne Park, a shift we had made soon after Bob and Trish
  had returned. Trish was increasingly missing home and, with work still
  uncertain for Bob, the decision was taken to return to Vancouver. With their
  departure, our family unit returned again to Olive, Norman, Gramp, Chrissie
  and me.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><font face="Arial">My
  parents had continued to take an interest in what I was doing at university
  and in sport. Norman continued to be official scorer and Olive joined the
  ‘baseball girls’, the wives of players, and busied herself in various
  fundraising activities for the club. I was introduced to live theatre with my
  parents taking me to musicals such as Oklahoma! and the Black and White
  Minstrel Show.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2"><font face="Arial">The move to Westbourne Park had
  another, unexpected sequel. Invited by a school friend to attend the nearby
  Methodist Church, I met Charmian and, on the Easter Bob and Trish returned to
  Canada, ‘got religion’. Olive and Norman showed a degree of caution about
  my overly enthusiastic embrace of religion. Olive, in her usual diplomatic
  way, did not openly disapprove of my involvement, but resisted any overtures
  from me to attend services. However, in their typical hospitable way, my
  parents welcomed friends from the church into our home and took an ongoing
  interest in them.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p>

  By the end of 1958, I had graduated in Pharmacy from
  the University of Adelaide and plans were well underway for Norman, Olive and
  me to visit Bob, Trish, Burk and (by now) Stacey in Vancouver. However, the
  relationship between Charmian and me had reached a stage where events would
  overturn my plans. In January, Charmian became pregnant and I told my parents
  of my decision to marry and not come with them to Canada. Olive’s initial
  reaction was one of disappointment, but she rapidly put that aside and threw
  herself into preparations for the wedding. I was again caught up in my own
  needs and had little thought or feeling for the fact that I had imposed a
  wedding on them, just a few weeks before their departure for Canada.
