  Frai&apos;s voice broke on the words and she turned from the gathering in the

  Olive&apos;s Canadian family.</font><o:p>

  words that followed, from Malcolm McArthur, family friend and the officiating
  minister, faded like campfire smoke drifting into the air, the attention of
  the congregation drawn to the front of the chapel where Olive&apos;s
  flower-draped coffin lay basking in the sunlight of a early Spring afternoon.
  The glass wall of the chapel behind the coffin gave onto an enclosed
  courtyard, the golden light of the sandstone walls highlighting the rich green
  of the fernery.<o:p>

  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">As
  people had gathered for the funeral, Chalien and Ricki had handed each one a
  small spray of flowers, tributes prepared by Charmian. Slowly Malcolm&apos;s
  words began to enter consciousness. He was speaking of the &apos;language of
  flowers&apos;, recalling Biblical references to their beauty and their ability to
  heal, and linking the idea to the earlier reading by Lorene: &apos;For every
  thing there is a season, and a time for every purpose under heaven: a time to
  be born and a time to die …&apos;.<a title style="mso-footnote-id: ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span style="mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[1]</span></a>
  The silence in the chapel was respectful, even reverential, as I walked to the
  lectern and stood for a moment gathering myself, before I looked out at the
  small gathering of friends and family.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">&apos;Mum
  hated funerals,&apos; I began. &apos;As far as I know she hasn&apos;t attended one for
  80 years. She also wasn&apos;t one to seek the limelight. Well, she can&apos;t
  escape this funeral, and she can&apos;t escape being the focus of our loving
  attention.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">&apos;Olive
  Myrtle Scott was born on the 8th of March 1905, the fourth child of Fred and
  Lily Scott. Her mother&apos;s family was a large one and she had the pleasure of
  being surrounded by many uncles and aunts. Her aunts Maudie and May were
  especially dear to her. She had many stories of her childhood at Mile End,
  every one embroidered with fine detail. She could tell you what dress she
  wore, the design on its collar, what the weather was like, and what flowers
  were in bloom, reporting, if not verbatim, then with remarkable consistency,
  who said what to whom and when. And every story spilled over with humour and
  laughter. Mum was our oral historian and her stories gave shape to our lives.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">&apos;Her
  father, Fred, served in France in World War 1 and, only weeks after he
  returned, her mother Lily died in the influenza epidemic of 1919. Mum reports
  that she decided, by herself, that it was necessary for her to leave school
  and go to work to help support her father and younger sister. This action was
  typical of her throughout her life – the readiness to look for practical
  solutions to life&apos;s problems, and the acceptance of realities without
  complaint. When confronted by life&apos;s conundrums, Mum simply and cheerfully
  &quot;got on with the job&quot;.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">&apos;Her
  youth and early adulthood were spent in the golden era of the flapper and the
  Charleston. Photos of the time show them on picnics at Belair National Park,
  Victor Harbor and other places – a carefree time full of promise and
  possibilities. <o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">&apos;In
  the Spring of 1928, Olive married Norman Quintrell and, on their second
  wedding anniversary, my brother Bob was born. The early 1930s were formative
  times for many people and equally for this young couple. They had a new baby
  and my father had only part-time work, so it needed all Mum&apos;s practical
  skills to weave their way through the maze of the Depression. In 1937 I was
  born and, by the time I was old enough to form memories of my own, war had
  been declared and my father had enlisted in the Air Force. My father served in
  New Guinea and it&apos;s not easy to imagine the level of stress that Olive would
  have experienced with a husband in the war zone and two young children, one
  given to bouts of asthma, to bring up herself. My earliest memories of my
  mother are of a young woman under strain, yet always there for me, always
  concerned and involved with her children&apos;s needs. I was then, as I am now,
  easily moved to tears and what I remember most is Mum&apos;s hands – the cool
  hand on a fevered brow, the gentle touch that soothed distress.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">&apos;The
  war ended and Dad returned home. I remember my late childhood as an exuberant
  time, as if society was experiencing a delayed adolescence, or enjoying a
  particularly beautiful Spring after a long, bitter Winter. There were family
  gatherings, picnics and parties, barbecues and sporting events, and my parents
  were often the organisers and energisers of these.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">&apos;And
  Mum smiled again. And danced. And threw herself into new things with renewed
  and wonderful energy. She started a florist business from home - my father had
  to dig up the whole backyard and put it under flowerbeds - and when Mum went
  to work at Central Florists, they smoothed it all out again and made a tennis
  court. From that time on and forever, it&apos;s with flowers that I associate
  Mum. She delighted in growing things. Plants had personalities for her. She
  described plants that weren&apos;t thriving as &apos;sulky&apos;, or &apos;just needing a
  bit of encouragement&apos;, or &apos;having their hearts broken&apos;, or of &apos;not
  getting a fair go&apos;. And plants grew for her. She knew about the need to give
  care and encouragement, and gave it generously.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">&apos;She
  was a generous woman, but not irresponsible or wasteful. She had learned hard
  lessons during the Depression and the War, so she was thoughtful in giving,
  but never grudging. Gifts of goods, praise or encouragement were given
  generously, wisely and unconditionally. If anyone broke the stereotype of the
  mean-spirited mother-in-law, it was Mum. Charmian remembers receiving clothing
  for the children – never one singlet or jumper, but always three or four at
  once, and always one size too large so they would grow into them and they
  would last longer. Trish, Olive&apos;s Canadian daughter-in-law, often spoke of
  Mum&apos;s consistent, non-judgmental support through many difficult years. <o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">&apos;Which
  brings me to her Canadian family. They cannot be here today, but as you have
  heard, they dearly loved their Aussie grandmother. My brother, Bob, married in
  Canada and had four children who still live there. During the long and
  difficult period of my brother&apos;s divorce and subsequent estrangement from
  his children, Mum never let go of the family ties. Patiently and
  unconditionally she wove strands of love and care across the width of the
  Pacific Ocean and, after my father&apos;s death, she travelled to Canada to spend
  a critically important time with her Canadian family. In the story I wrote
  about my brother&apos;s untimely death in 1988, I use another metaphor in a scene
  in which the character representing Bob is about to return to Canada. &apos;Our
  mother has built a bridge,&apos; Bob&apos;s character says, &apos;and I have to cross
  it.&apos; And he did cross the bridge - built with Mum&apos;s patient, loving and
  unshakeable commitment to family - and did re-establish relationships with his
  children before he died.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">&apos;At
  her 90<sup>th</sup> birthday, I said something like, &quot;History is mainly
  written about emperors and queens and politicians and explorers and suchlike.
  But the vast majority of us live our lives in circumstances in which we have
  to learn to deal with the everyday realities of life: how to laugh when
  we&apos;re happy and cry when we&apos;re sad, how to have fun, and how to celebrate
  successes and deal with failures. We learn these things not from books, but
  from those who go before us and deal with life&apos;s problems practically and
  successfully, who celebrate the simple pleasures of life and patiently endure
  its pains and struggles. It is from them we learn loyalty, compassion,
  generosity and love&quot;.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">&apos;Over
  the last few days, the thing that moves me most often to tears is not so much
  the sadness of Olive&apos;s passing but when I try to find words to express the
  gratitude for what she has given to me and my family. The Canadian Quintrells
  have said it for me: &quot;Grannie defined the word &apos;family&apos; for us.&quot;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">&apos;When
  I&apos;ve spoken to various ones of you over the last few days, the words you
  have most often used to describe Mum are &quot;generous&quot;, &quot;welcoming&quot;,
  &quot;supportive&quot;, and &quot;a beautiful person&quot;, and almost all of you have
  made reference to one quality of hers that we all remember - her laughter. One
  of our family jokes has been that Grannie will never die, she will just get
  smaller and smaller and disappear, and all that will be left are the echoes of
  her laughter.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">&apos;Well,
  now she is gone. But after the tears have been shed, the echoes of her
  laughter will remain in every one of us who knew her and loved her.&apos;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">I
  picked up my notes and returned to my seat and to the comfort of Charmian&apos;s
  hand on mine. The funeral director cued in the chosen music, a harp and flute
  duet. The music floated in the chapel, as gentle as an autumn breeze, as soft
  as the petals of a rose, the flute soaring over the rippling harp, each person
  left to contemplate the effect of the deceased on their own finite lives.
  Malcolm gathered up the thoughts of the mourners into final prayers,
  committing Olive&apos;s remains to the elements as the coffin was lowered into
  the floor. <o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">A
  blessing having been conferred, people moved slowly from their seats,
  exchanging wordless hugs of comfort and affection. I had chosen &quot;Autumn
  Leaves&quot; as the final musical piece, and as I left the chapel wondered again
  about my choice, the memory that prompted its inclusion still elusive. The
  symbolism of beauty at the end of flowering was obvious, but there was also
  some connection with childhood that could not be contained in words - some
  trace memory of the family of childhood sitting around the radio on a
  winter&apos;s evening with the fire burning, evoking feelings of security and
  peacefulness. I shivered, the held-back emotion breaking through. I wiped
  tears from my eyes.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">&apos;You
  OK?&apos; Charmian enquired softly.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">I
  nodded mutely.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">She

  CHILDHOOD YEARS: ADELAIDE 1905 - 1914<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></b><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Olive
  was born in the years history has named &apos;the Edwardian era&apos; which
  stretches from 1901 when Edward VII was crowned, to the outbreak of war in
  Europe in 1914. It is seen as a time when the world moved from one of
  established order to the beginnings of the modern world, encompassing social
  reform, technological invention and philosophical and artistic exploration and
  expression; a world trembling on the brink of changes that would affect the
  course of history in profound ways. Two years earlier Wilbur and Orville
  Wright had made their historical first successful powered flight and, as 1905
  opened, their improved plane made a flight of nearly 40 km. The revolution in
  transport would see the times of travel shrink from the months it had taken
  Olive&apos;s grandparents to sail from England to Australia in the 1860s to less
  than a day by the time she died. In 1905, a revolution of another kind was
  brewing in Russia and a succession of events during the year paved the way for
  the Bolshevik revolution of 1917 that ended Tsarist rule and ushered in what
  would become the &quot;Cold War&quot; and dominate political realities for much of
  the 20<sup>th</sup> century. Australia had gained its own identity in the
  world with the formation of the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901, but
  national allegiances were still strongly oriented to Britain, the &apos;mother
  country&apos;. One item of local interest that Olive&apos;s descendants may like
  noted is that competitive netball was played in Adelaide for the first time in
  1905! <o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>On March 8, 1905 in Adelaide, world events would have been far from
  Fred and Lily Scott&apos;s minds as they cradled their newborn daughter Olive
  Myrtle, a sister for Alice, Arnie and Cyril. She was probably named for Olive
  Alice, Lily&apos;s younger sister who had died in infancy in 1888, and Eva
  Myrtle, a younger sister of Fred&apos;s, who had also died before her first
  birthday. The recycling of names was not uncommon. Lily herself bore the name
  of an older sister who had also died in infancy. <o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>The Adelaide into which Olive was born was a small, well-laid out city,
  a grid of streets within its literal &apos;square mile&apos;, bounded by parklands.
  Cars would have been few and, although the first electric tram was introduced
  in 1909, horse-drawn trams provided public transport through Olive&apos;s
  childhood. Street lighting for the city had arrived some years earlier.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Olive&apos;s
  childhood was happy and unmarked by tragedy. She is seen in photos with the
  family dog, on horseback, climbing trees with her brothers, at her
  grandfather&apos;s knee in a family photograph, and watched by a smiling Lily as
  she picks fruit from a tree in the back yard of her grandparents&apos; home. She
  is carefully dressed, often in flounced white dresses with knee-high white
  socks. Her hair hangs to her shoulders in ringlets and is caught with ribbons.
  Both Lily and Fred had eight siblings, so Olive was surrounded by aunts and
  uncles, and the extended family gave her plenty of opportunities for loving
  attention and play. Her mother&apos;s youngest sister, Linda, was only 5 years
  older than Olive, and her brothers Arnie and Cyril, 5 and 3 years older, were
  imaginative and mischievous playmates. The aptly-named Mile End where they
  lived provided easy access to the city and its markets and plenty of room to
  roam. Grandfather Edwin owned a butcher shop on Fisher Terrace (now South
  Road, a busy arterial highway), and kept chickens and sheep for slaughter on
  neighbouring fields<a title style="mso-footnote-id: ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><span style="mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[2]</span></a>.
  At what would now be seen as a very young age, the children were allowed to
  roam the fields, climbing trees, running with Rover, their pet border collie,
  or on horseback on Dolly the family horse. The era was gentler, slower paced,
  and the city safer than today. It was not unusual for Olive to be sent alone
  across the parklands to the city on errands for her mother or grandparents and
  some of her early childhood stories revolve around the horse trams and visits
  to the Central Market in the west end of the city.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">One
  of her first clear memories involves the departure of her grandfather, Edwin
  Pearce, for England to be at the coronation of King George V. Olive recalls
  being puzzled about his leaving. &apos;Why would anyone want to travel so far,
  just to see someone place a crown on the King&apos;s head?&apos; she wondered. The
  family waved to Edwin, dapper in his new suit and bowler hat, as his ship
  pulled away from the wharf at Port Adelaide. He promised to wave a white
  handkerchief so Olive could see him from the wharf. &apos;I waved and waved,&apos;
  she reports, &apos;but whether I was waving to <i>his</i> handkerchief or not, I
  couldn&apos;t tell.&apos; As they turned to go, Olive, holding on to her mother&apos;s
  hand, thought to herself, &apos;Well, that&apos;s the end of Grandpa. I&apos;ll never
  see him again.&apos;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Edwin
  would have been 50 years old, having left England, at age 17, on March 1876
  aboard the &apos;Northern Monarch&apos;. He arrived at Port Adelaide on the 12<sup>th</sup>
  of June 1876. It seems likely that he felt a strong connection for the place
  of his birth, and, for him, the coronation would have been an important event.
  In spite of Olive&apos;s dire prediction, Edwin did return to Australia and
  continued to operate his butcher&apos;s business at Mile End until his death. He
  was patron of the local football team and, it would seem, a loved father and
  grandfather. In the infamous &apos;Lily and the potted palm&apos; photograph<a title style="mso-footnote-id: ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><span style="mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[3]</span></a>,
  taken a few years after his return, Olive is seen seated comfortably on his
  knee with his arm around her waist. In the only photographs I have of him, he
  looks calmly at the camera exuding a sense of quiet and dignified composure,
  seemingly confident of his place in the world.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Olive&apos;s childhood
  memories are unremarkable. <o:p>
  </o:p>
  Her parents had married early, Fred 20 and Lily 16, when Lily was pregnant
  with Olive&apos;s older sister, Alice. They spent their early married life living
  near Lily&apos;s parents. Fred had a produce round, selling fruit and vegetables
  door to door. When Olive was quite young, and before her younger sister Lily
  was born, they moved to Hilton. She remembers the move, the furniture piled
  onto a horse-drawn dray. It had begun to rain lightly and, in order to protect
  the pet budgerigar, her mother travelled to their new home inside the
  wardrobe, carrying the caged bird.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her
  father continued his produce round, but also established a small shopfront at
  their house. <o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">&apos;It
  was hard for him to make a go of it,&apos; Olive reports, &apos;with all the
  relations expecting free fruit and veg. Cyril was a real tattletale. If any of
  the relatives came and took anything, he&apos;d pipe up &quot;I&apos;m going to tell
  Dad you took that&quot;.&apos;<o:p>
  </o:p>

  <p class="MsoBodyText" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">She

  some occasions, she was allowed to collect the eggs from the fowls kept at her
  grandfather&apos;s house. She recalls collecting 72 eggs on a particular day, an
  unusually high yield. Carrying her bowl of fresh eggs triumphantly back to the

  the bounty. Was she punished? I asked her. &apos;A severe scolding for being

  of Olive&apos;s early tasks was, on a Saturday, to go on the horse tram from
  their home at Hilton to collect meat from grandfather&apos;s shop and a can of
  chicken broth from the west end market. She was given the penny fare for the
  tram, and sixpence to spend on sweets.</font><o:p>

  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">The
  trams ran on rails and the carriages had two levels. Normally, women and
  children sat on the lower, enclosed decks and men on the upper deck, which was
  open in summer but with canvas sides that could be rolled down in poor
  weather. The trams were drawn by a pair of horses and, given their heads, the
  horses could get the trams rolling at a fair clip. The track ran dead straight
  for most of its run but curved as it entered the city. If the horses had
  picked up too much speed, and the top deck was crowded, it was not unusual for
  the carriage to jump the tracks, bringing the horses and tram to a sudden
  halt. Everyone would have to descend from the tram and the men would push the
  carriage back onto the tracks before the journey could be continued.<o:p>

  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Olive remembers
  one particular visit on a warm December day, a couple of weeks before
  Christmas. Dressed in a light brown cotton dress, with lace appliqué at the
  collar, and carrying her can for the broth, Olive boarded the horse tram. She
  offered her penny to the conductor for the ride and checked that her sixpence
  was securely knotted in the corner of her handkerchief. The lower deck of the
  tram would have been crowded with mothers and their children going to shop at
  the market. On the top deck, the canvas awnings would have been drawn back and
  men, in their shirtsleeves, but waist-coated and hatted, would have enjoyed
  the breeze as the horses trotted along. On this day, the tram held to the
  tracks as the corner into Grote Street was negotiated.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Olive
  alighted with the other passengers near the Post Office in Victoria Square.
  She may have dallied for a time in the shade of the spreading Moreton Bay fig
  tree, listening to the Salvation Army band. Her attention would have been
  drawn to a ring of people near the Post Office and she wormed her way to the
  front to see what was happening. In the centre of the ring a man sat on a low
  stool. On the ground alongside him was a pair of crutches. Crippled, whether
  from birth or by misadventure, he eked out a living from a troupe of trained
  dogs, some of which were attached by chains to the legs of other stools. On
  command, they would perform tricks – leaping from stool to stool like
  miniature circus lions, standing on their hind legs, or kneeling to &apos;pray&apos;
  while the man recited the Lord&apos;s Prayer. Other dogs trotted around the ring
  holding tins in their mouths into which people threw pennies. Olive&apos;s hand
  closed over her sixpence, but it was too great a sacrifice and she resisted
  any temptation to contribute.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">There
  was a sudden commotion. A stray dog had entered the ring and launched itself
  at one of the smaller dogs. There was a pandemonium of barking and growling
  and some of the dogs took off down the road, upsetting water dishes and
  scattering money and trailing their stools behind them as they fled. The
  crippled man shouted at his dogs to return and a couple of men tried to
  separate the brawling dogs. Gradually order was restored. Some of the crowd
  retrieved the fleeing dogs while others collected the scattered pennies. The
  marauder was dispatched, howling, with a kick to its rear.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Olive
  made her way back across the square to the market bearing her billycan and
  with her hand clasped over the sweat-damp corner of her handkerchief where her
  sixpence burned to be spent. What lay in wait for her in the alleyway to the
  side of the market were the touts for Bruce&apos;s cheapjack, selling tickets for
  sixpence for a turn on the wheel. This may have been the day when Olive&apos;s
  life-long enjoyment of the small wager began as she yielded up her sixpence
  for a chance on the wheel.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">The
  prizes on offer ranged from a pair of shoelaces or a box of matches to a giant
  Christmas Stocking and a Christmas goose. The required number of tickets
  having been sold, the cheapjack man called out to the players to gather as he
  spun the wheel. Partly in fear, realising she was participating in something
  forbidden, and partly in excitement at the possibility of winning, Olive
  watched the numbers rush past the pointer as the wheel turned.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">&apos;Number
  29! Who has number 29?&apos; the man called.<o:p>

  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">There,
  staring at Olive from its cage as if she was its mortal enemy, was a live
  goose. The enormity of her action was now apparent. How could she get a live
  goose and the chicken broth home on the tram? How could she explain to her
  mother that she had failed to buy sweets but had gambled her money on the
  cheapjack?<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">&apos;Please
  sir,&apos; she stammered to the man who towered above her, &apos;can I come back in
  a minute?&apos;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">&apos;Certainly,
  young lady,&apos; he bellowed, his voice booming across the market. Then to her
  retreating back as if in accusation, &apos;She won the goose! The young lady won
  the goose!&apos;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">&apos;I
  walked around the market for a while,&apos; Olive told me, &apos;and then I thought,
  if I could exchange the goose for a Stocking for my baby sister Lily, mother
  couldn&apos;t be cross at me. So I went back to the man on the cheapjack and
  asked if I could have the Stocking instead. I was mortified because he
  bellowed out to the whole market &quot;What do you think of that? She wants a
  Stocking for her baby sister instead of the goose&quot;. But he gave me the
  Stocking and I got Bruces&apos; the butchers to wrap it up so Lily wouldn&apos;t see
  it, and struggled home with the stocking, the broth, and the bag of meat from
  Grandpa&apos;s. I got into trouble for being late, but when I told Mum about the
  cheapjack and the goose and the stocking for Lily, I got off light. I think
  Mum had to actually stop from smiling and Dad laughed out loud. The Stocking
  stayed on the top of the wardrobe, wrapped up in butchers&apos; paper, until
  Christmas. Lily got her Stocking, and I may have missed out on my
  sixpenny-worth of sweets, but I avoided a hiding.&apos;<o:p>

  <p class="MsoBodyText" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">On
  the same day, the newspaper also reported a partial eclipse of the sun.
  Although Olive did not know it, portents of problems in her parents&apos;
  marriage were also appearing. A year or more before, her mother had begun an
  affair with a family friend and her young sister, Lily, was born of that
  liaison. In the manner of the time, Lily was brought up as a child of the
  marriage, but what effect this had on the marriage relationship can only be
  guessed at. Other family members believe that the affair continued and, when
  war was declared in 1914, Fred enlisted to distance himself from the affair.
  Whatever his motives for enlistment were, the facts are that by the time Olive
  was 10, her father was absent in France. Soon after Fred returned from the
  war, her mother was dead. As Olive tells it, her mother died in the influenza
  epidemic of 1919. But more recent stories suggest another possibility …<o:p>
