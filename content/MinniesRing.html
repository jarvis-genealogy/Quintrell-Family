      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was always just &apos;Minnie&apos;s Ring&apos;, an insignificant 
      gold band with five small diamond chips. Mum kept it with her other 
      treasures; a fake ruby necklace and earrings, a jade brooch, an artificial 
      emerald necklace, and sundry baubles, bangles and beads. When Mum died, I 
      was tempted to throw the ring, now minus a couple of its diamond chips, 
      into the rubbish. It had no commercial or, as far as I knew, sentimental 
      value. But Mum had referred to it often enough to cause me to pause. </p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am standing in the kitchen of our house at Black 
      Forest<span lang="en-au">. I am about twelve years old&mdash;o</span>ld enough to be able to move 
      around the neighbourhood unsupervised. Mum and Dad are obviously away 
      somewhere because I am asking my Aunt Chrissie if I may go to the movies 
      in the afternoon with friends. She is my mother&apos;s maiden aunt, a short, 
      chubby woman of about 60 with grey hair<span lang="en-au"> who</span> has lived with us for as 
      long as I can remember. Her facial features are thick and she is beginning 
      to sprout bits of hair from her chin. In my child&apos;s eye, she is plain and 
      unattractive, offering none of the warmth and tenderness of my mother. I 
      am wary of her sharp tongue. </p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">She is crying and doesn&apos;t want to give me permission. 
      Unused to displays of emotion other than a sort of grumbling criticism 
      from her, I am discomforted and look down at my feet, mumbling &apos;<span lang="en-au">Oh,
      </span>I&apos;ll be alright.&apos; She tells me that her brother <span lang="en-au">
      Alf</span> is dying. I have had no 
      experience of death, so I have no understanding of what feelings are 
      shaking her and I am surly and stubborn. I want to go to the movies and to 
      escape from the sight of her tear-streaked face. Whether she relented and 
      allowed me to go, I cannot recall, but this was the only time I saw her 
      cry.</p>
      <p ALIGN="CENTER">*******************</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Twentyfive years later, I am seated in one of the small 
      chapels at Centennial Park cemetery. A minister assigned by the funeral 
      parlour is rolling out the familiar phrases that encourage us to believe 
      that Chrissie has passed into some heavenly realm where she will be 
      eternally at peace&mdash;at least until the Last Judgement. There are five 
      mourners; Charmian, an aunt and uncle, a cousin and myself. A few days 
      earlier I had stood with Mum at her bedside, listening to her laboured 
      breathing. Her body was a small mound in the bed, her sparse hair a 
      straggle of grey on the pillow. Did we speak of her life? I can&apos;t recall. 
      We were both sharply aware that in another hospital a few kilometres away 
      my father&apos;s life was also at the ebb. Chrissie, who had lived with my 
      parents for most of their married life, at least had the decency to 
      predecease my father, if only by a few days.</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The minister&apos;s voice is finally silent and we watch the 
      coffin lowered into the floor. The minister blesses us and we leave the 
      chapel. A few tributes of flowers have been offered&mdash;my mother, aunts and 
      uncles&mdash;and among them a single long-stemmed rose. The funeral director 
      collects the cards from the wreaths and hands them to me. The card from 
      the single rose reads &apos;From your unknown daughter&apos;. It is unsigned.</p>
      <p ALIGN="CENTER">********************</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Twenty years after the funeral, Charmian and I are in 
      the car one Sunday afternoon. Mum, and her good friend Marge, are in the 
      back seat, and we are driving around the Port Adelaide area where Mum 
      lived as a child. The talk turns to family members and Chrissie&apos;s name is 
      mentioned. The conversation is full of oblique references and hints, the 
      listeners left to draw the threads together and weave their own story. Mum 
      and Marge are recalling a boat trip to Ardrossan to visit
      <span lang="en-au">Alf</span> and and his 
      wife Minnie when she and Marge were children. How young were they? Five 
      years old perhaps? Chrissie is there and &apos;Gran Scott&apos;&mdash;Chrissie&apos;s mother, a 
      midwife. The sea is grey and choppy. A cold wind whips seaspray across the 
      deck. The boat rolls and dips. Chrissie is seasick. The story is 
      impressionistic, shapeless, a child&apos;s memoir, but the undercurrents are 
      palpable.</p>
      <p ALIGN="CENTER">**********************************</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was my mother&apos;s cousin, daughter of Chrissie&apos;s 
      sister<span lang="en-au"> Emma,</span> <span lang="en-au">who</span> brought the story out of the shadows. </p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&apos;Minnie Hayes had a younger brother,&apos; she told me a few 
      years after Mum died. &apos;A dark, good-looking lad so they say. It was him 
      who got Chrissie pregnant. Minnie was also pregnant at about the same 
      time. But Minnie&apos;s baby was stillborn. So Gran Jarvis took Chrissie to 
      Ardrossan either to have her baby, or after the ba<span lang="en-au">b</span>y was born. I guess they 
      thought Ollie and Marge would be too young to know what was going on, but 
      they obviously picked up enough to put two and two together and get close 
      enough to four. So it was Gran who delivered Chrissie&apos;s baby, a 
      daughter, and Minnie and <span lang="en-au">Alf</span> took her on and reared her as their own. A 
      neat solution for all concerned.&apos;</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&apos;Did&mdash;what was the daughter&apos;s name …?&apos; I ask.</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&apos;Elsie.&apos;</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&apos;Did Elsie know that she was adopted?&apos;</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&apos;Not until Chrissie had died.&apos;</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&apos;So all her life, Chrissie was just her &quot;maiden aunt&quot;.&apos;</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&apos;That would have been the way of it.&apos;</p>
      <p ALIGN="CENTER">************************************</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nearly thirty years after her death, ninety years since 
      she sailed to Ardossan, either cradling her on daughter, or huddled in an 
      overcoat to cover the shame of her swollen belly, I have to reconstruct my 
      image of Chrissie. The few faded black-and-white photographs that remain 
      are unflattering and it&apos;s hard to see her as young and spirited. Yet 
      somewhere in her early twenties a spark of passion leaped the gap between 
      Chrissie and Minnie&apos;s brother. Within what I remember as a dumpy old woman 
      pulsed not only the memory of youthful passion, but also the twisting pain 
      of watching her own daughter grow up calling another woman &apos;mother&apos;. I 
      have always seen her as a frustrated, virginal old maid. But she had 
      experienced some form of loving, and had been denied its full expression. 
      The values of the times would have laid a burden of guilt on her, and the 
      presence of her daughter within the family circle would have only made 
      that heavier. </p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fifty-five years ago, as I pleaded with Chrissie to 
      allow my own selfish needs to be with my mates, I had no understanding of 
      or compassion for Chrissie. How could I know that the tears spilling onto 
      her cheeks were not only for the pain of losing a loved brother, but for 
      her the sense of loss she had had to carry for her whole life. And the 
      only remaining symbol is a slim gold band with missing stones that, like 
      her daughter, had belonged to someone else.</p>

      about 5 at the time, Chrissie would have been about 24 and Alf, 29.</i></span></p>
