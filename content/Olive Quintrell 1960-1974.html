  THE SIXTIES: &quot;THE TIMES THEY ARE A&apos; CHANGING&quot;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span><o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2"><font face="Arial">Their overseas trip had been, in
  Olive&apos;s words &apos;a real eye-opener&apos;. She had seen the poverty of Asia and
  the opulence of Beverley Hills. She had experienced the alienation of New York
  and the intimacy of a quiet walk along a deserted Spanish beach. She had known
  the generosity of strangers and the rudeness of hotel clerks. She had been
  dazzled by the New World of America and affirmed her roots in the Old World
  charm of London. The more bohemian ways of &apos;Gay Paris&apos; had confronted her
  sensibilities, and the &apos;smiling, polite Canadians&apos;<a title style="mso-footnote-id: ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span style="mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[1]</span></a>
  had beguiled her. She and Norman had &apos;seen the world&apos;, often as the only
  Australians in the tour group and were left with a quiet pride in their
  country and a feeling of their right to belong as world citizens. The trip had
  many overtones of a &apos;second honeymoon&apos;, and she and Norman must have
  settled back into the rhythms of Adelaide life with satisfaction about their
  lot.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><font face="Arial">They took
  on the role of grandparenthood with generosity and pleasure. From 1960 to
  1963, they added three new grandchildren to their number &mdash; Stephen Mitchell in
  July 1960, Lorene Peta in July 1961, and Frai Charmian in November 1963. They
  moved into a newly built house in Hawthorn. Chrissie was still a fixture in
  the household but, in January 1960, Grandpa Steve died aged 89.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><font face="Arial">Olive
  again set about the task of making a new garden that now included place for a
  swing and sandpit for the grandchildren. During the sixties, both Olive and
  Norman moved into their own sixtieth years and their lives settled into a more
  sedate pace than that of the late Forties and early Fifties. Norman joined the
  nearby bowls club, Olive returned to work at Central Florists, continued to
  meet with the &apos;baseball girls&apos; and pursue her love of craft. However,
  events in the world and in her Canadian family were moving in ways that would
  have a significant impact on them and family relationships.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><font face="Arial">Through
  the sixties, there was a sea change in Africa and the geo-political map of
  that country was re-written. By the end of the sixties, only three countries,
  most notably South Africa, were left under colonial rule. The Berlin wall was
  constructed, straining Cold War relations further and the Cuban missile crisis
  brought the United States and the USSR to the brink of war. The USA was in
  turmoil as protests about the Vietnam War escalated. The Kennedys and Martin
  Luther King were assassinated. In 1969, less than 12 years since people had
  stood in the street to watch the path of Sputnik, Neil Armstrong and Buzz
  Aldrin walked on the moon and we watched it live on television. In Canada,
  Charles deGaulle incensed the Canadian government by publicly supporting
  Quebec&apos;s claims for independence.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><font face="Arial">However,
  it was on the west coast of Canada that events more personal to Olive and
  Norman were afoot. In 1964, Bob phoned to say that he would be able to make a
  brief visit to Adelaide. The excitement of the visit was overshadowed by
  another call, this time from Trish, indicating that there were serious strains
  in the marriage, but asking that nothing be said during the visit unless Bob
  initiated it. Respecting Trish&apos;s request, the visit proceeded with no one
  raising the matter<a title style="mso-footnote-id: ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><span style="mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[2]</span></a>,
  but the issue was now very much in Olive and Norman&apos;s minds.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><font face="Arial">I have no
  records of this time to give me access to Olive&apos;s experience, and my own
  memories are constrained by my own self-interests of a demanding job, a young
  family and a chronic illness. What is clear is that Olive set out to hold in
  tension her commitment to her &apos;Canadian family&apos; and her continuing support
  for her elder son. When Bob&apos;s marriage dissolved and the letters from Trish
  were becoming increasingly strident as she gave vent to her hurt and pain,
  Olive wrote regularly and sent gifts for every birthday and Christmas. I do
  not know what she wrote in those letters as she walked the tightrope that
  allowed her to stay in contact with Trish without abandoning her loyalty to
  her son, but it must have drawn on all the skills in diplomacy that she had.<o:p>

  Neil, Norman, Olive and Bob at the Hotel Australia, 1964.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><font face="Arial">Olive
  had, of course, her own concerns. Norman was having health problems. He had
  developed diabetes and hypertension and, driven by a feeling that he was no
  longer physically able to deal with the maintenance of their house as well as
  a desire for greater financial security, he chose &mdash; against Olive&apos;s better
  judgement&mdash;to sell their house in Hawthorn and move into a smaller unit.
  This move was unsuccessful. Olive was unhappy in the confines of the small
  unit with the three of them &mdash; Chrissie, of course, still in residence &mdash;
  and wanted more space. They shifted again, to a larger house in Brighton and,
  finally to a unit in Toorak Gardens.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><font face="Arial">While
  they were at Brighton, Bob, now married to Barbara, returned to Australia.
  Neither Olive or Norman warmed to Bob&apos;s new wife, but they covered their
  dislike as best they could and accepted the challenge of continuing to contact
  and support the Canadian part of their family while offering support to Bob
  and Barbara. It was not easy for Bob to get work and, after some lean years in
  Adelaide, he and Barbara moved first to Perth and then, in the early 1970s, to
  Wollongong.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><font face="Arial">In the
  ten years since they had walked (in my imagination, hand in hand) on a quiet
  beach in sunny Spain and felt their life satisfying complete, Olive and
  Norman&apos;s life had become much more problematic. Norman&apos;s health was now
  declining and he was working part-time, Bob&apos;s drinking was emerging as a
  serious problem, and the family in Canada were struggling in more ways than
  Olive knew. I was not helping as I was developing political ideas at variance
  with my father&apos;s by publicly opposing the war in Vietnam in letters to the
  paper and joining street protests. The hopes for the future with which they
  had sailed from Sydney in 1959 had not come to fruition and the approaching
  Seventies must have looked very different to them from the possibilities at
  the end of the Fifties.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><font face="Arial">But
  through all of this, what I recall as I now reflect on the time is their quiet
  and good-humoured generosity. There were practical gifts of clothing for our
  expanding family, regular offers of baby&mdash;sitting (including precious weekends
  away with their invaluable contribution to our marriage relationship), and the
  loan of money (from probably fairly scarce resources) that allowed us to buy
  the land and build the house in Hawthorndene. When we had a road accident
  outside Port Fairy in 1968, writing off our car and our front teeth, Norman
  drove to Port Fairy to pick us up and bring us home again. Whatever was
  happening in the world and in their own lives, the commitment to their family
  was unswerving.</font></p>

  <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">THE SEVENTIES: SADNESS AND NEW HOPE<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></font></span></b></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="tab-stops: 135.0pt" align="left"><sup><font size="3" face="Arial">In
  the seventies, JK Galbraith published a political commentary on the times
  dubbing it &apos;The age of uncertainty&apos; and certainly the Seventies turned
  Olive&apos;s life on its head. Bob&apos;s drinking led eventually to the end of his
  marriage, the loss of his job at the Illawarra Mercury in Wollongong and, by
  the end of the decade, his return to face the total uncertainty of what lay in
  wait for him Canada. In 1974, after several months of hospitalisation, Norman
  died of congestive heart failure and, in the following year, I watched
  Olive&apos;s diminutive figure, stooped but firm with determination, walk across
  the tarmac at Adelaide Airport to begin her journey to Canada. She would have
  been just 70 and, as I approach that age myself, I begin to get some of the
  meaning of that journey. Not much more than 6 months widowed after 47 years of
  marriage, she set out alone to live with her Canadian family. There can be
  little doubt that her travel experiences of 1959 had contributed to a
  self-belief in the possibilities of international travel. But this time she
  went alone, driven by the need to build the bridge<a title style="mso-footnote-id: ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><span style="mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[3]</span></a>
  across the Pacific that linked the Australian and Canadian heritages of her
  grandchildren.</font></sup></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><sup><font size="3" face="Arial">The
  Australia she left in 1975 had seen some happy events and some significant
  upheavals. The Adelaide Festival Theatre opened and, in 1972, Australia
  elected its first non-conservative government for 23 years, leading to a
  ferment in Australian politics that would end with the famous (or infamous,
  depending on your political point of view) dismissal of the government in
  1977. Cyclone Tracy devastated Darwin on Christmas Eve of 1974. The Australian
  stock exchange saw one the greatest madnesses of share trading as Poseidon
  Ltd, whose shares had entered the market at 50c each, soared to an mazing $280
  per share and then crashed, virtually overnight, to less than a $1 when the
  vaunted mineral finds did not eventuate. People made and lost fortunes within
  days.</font></sup></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><sup><font size="3" face="Arial">In
  1972, Ricki Gaelle was born to us and both Olive and Norman delighted in their
  new grand-daughter. Before Ricki&apos;s birth, Charmian had begun a new career as
  a swimming instructor, which she continued for a time after Ricki&apos;s birth,
  and then began what was to become a life-long commitment to craft by
  developing her skills as a potter. I made the beginning of a career change,
  enrolling in Psychology at Flinders University and purchasing the
  newly-established campus pharmacy.</font></sup></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><sup><font size="3" face="Arial">It
  was a time for Olive of loss, of uncertainty, but of the creation of new
  possibilities.</font></sup></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><sup><font size="3" face="Arial">The
  time of Norman&apos;s illness and death was a difficult one. She and I visited
  the hospital almost daily from July to November. For the most part, Norman
  bore his dying stoically, joking about some of the other men in the ward and
  their peculiarities. However, on one occasion, following some (probably
  unnecessary) surgery, we found him distressed and, for the only time in my
  recollection, I saw my father in tears. Olive held him tenderly and soothed
  him as I waited, a stranger to their intimacy. Twice I called Bob to come from
  Wollongong as we thought Norman&apos;s condition was grave. However, on both
  occasions, he rallied and it was not until November 13th that I received an
  early morning call to tell me that he had died in the night. I drove down to
  their unit at Toorak Gardens and sat quietly with Olive, shedding tears as we
  recalled Norman&apos;s kind and generous life. Three days later, after Norman&apos;s
  funeral that, true to her life-long commitment<a title style="mso-footnote-id: ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><span style="mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[4]</span></a>,
  Olive did not attend, Bob, Charmian and I returned to the unit with Arnie,
  Alice, Cyril and Lily. The next couple of hours were full of family stories
  and laughter, grief released in its more buoyant form of celebrating a life.</font></sup></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><sup><font size="3" face="Arial">The
  trip to Canada &mdash; the story of which follows&mdash;was one expression of
  Olive&apos;s good&mdash;humoured determination to get on with her life.</font></sup></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><sup><font size="3" face="Arial">&apos;I
  decided that whenever anyone asked me to go somewhere, I&apos;d say &quot;Yes&quot;
  straightaway and worry later about whether I had the energy,&apos; she told me.
  &apos;I could always sleep in the next day!&apos;</font></sup></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><sup><font size="3" face="Arial">She
  and Norman had joined the senior citizens&apos; club at Burnside and she
  continued to go regularly. She continued to go to the &apos;baseball girls&apos;
  meetings. Charmian and I often took her and her good friend Marge Milkins<a title style="mso-footnote-id: ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"><span style="mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[5]</span></a>
  for drives on weekends and it was on these drives, that some of the family
  stories were told and others hinted at. Chrissie, who had been a fixture in
  their household since the Second World War, had died only a few days before
  Norman and, bit by bit, the story of a person who, to me, had been a rather
  prim and sour old maid took form<a title style="mso-footnote-id: ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"><span style="mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[6]</span></a>.</font></sup></p>
