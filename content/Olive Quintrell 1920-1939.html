  the back-story of Lily’s death, Olive’s life had taken a sudden turn. Her
  father, bereaved and disorientated after his return from France, would need
  support from, rather than be able to offer support to his family. Alice was
  engaged and would, within a year, be married – ironically to the son of
  Lily’s lover. Arnie and Cyril had left school and started work. Olive could
  have chosen to stay home and keep house for her father and young Lily, but
  this role was taken up by Chrissie, her father’s younger sister. With
  hindsight, it is easy to see why this arrangement would have suited Chrissie,
  who would later become a part of our family through my growing up years and
  beyond, and whose story is told below.<a title style="mso-footnote-id: ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span style="mso-special-character: footnote; font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[1]</span></a><o:p>

  </span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span style="font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Olive’s
  report was that she decided to leave school and go to work. The few mentions
  Olive ever made of her school years suggest that it may not have been a hard
  decision! She began work at a milliner’s in the city. She and her cousin
  Lorna Bailey, daughter of Emma, Fred’s sister, would walk to the city across
  the parklands to save the penny fare which would then allow them to buy a
  penny piece of cake for lunch. Her first wage was seven shillings and sixpence
  a week<a title style="mso-footnote-id: ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><span style="mso-special-character: footnote; font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[2]</span></a>,
  of which she gave her father five shillings<a title style="mso-footnote-id: ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><span style="mso-special-character: footnote; font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[3]</span></a>.

  </span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span style="font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">It
  was the flapper era. The newly-arrived radio played the Charleston, the Black
  Bottoms and the Varsity Rag. The hobble skirts of her mother’s time –
  which made climbing aboard and dismounting from the trams a problem – were
  now replaced by the short skirts of the twenties. By the end of the decade,
  the silent movie era would be finished as talkies made their debut with The
  Jazz Singer in 1929. Electric trams now ran in the streets of Adelaide and
  cars were becoming commonplace. ‘Adelaide boys’ Ross and Keith Smith made
  the first flight from England to Australia, and were followed by Bert Hinkler,
  who made the first solo flight. The first flight across Australia from
  Melbourne to Perth was accomplished in just under 24 hours. Olive saw Harry
  Butler, in his ‘Red Devil’ take off to make the first delivery of mail by
  air in South Australia. ‘It is estimated that he reached the dizzy altitude
  of 10,000 feet before he headed for the west,’ The Advertiser reported. The
  Duke and Duchess of York – who would become King George the Sixth and Queen
  Elizabeth on the abdication of George’s brother Edward – visited Adelaide
  in 1927 and Olive watched their progress from one of the buildings on North
  Terrace.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span style="font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">The
  future beckoned with promises of expanding possibilities. Olive’s father
  Fred and her brother Arnie were two who were especially excited by the ferment
  of the twenties. Fred began his own business as a butcher, which provided a
  greater affluence for the family. He purchased a car, a big Penn tourer with
  which there was much tinkering but little driving. Olive’s cousin Marge
  remembers the children being cajoled into pushing the car out into the street
  with Arnie at the driving wheel, and pushing it along with Arnie trying to get
  the motor started. It would fire, backfire, run a few yards with the children
  cheering it on, then the motor would cut out and the circus begin again. Marge
  is not sure that the car ever ran at all apart from these brief excursions
  around the block, after which the tinkering would begin again. In later life,
  Arnie built some of the first tourist buses to take to the Australian roads.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"><font face="Arial"><span style="font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="3">Arnie
  also dabbled in magic (and I recall parties when I was a child where he would
  do magic tricks for the children with his trademark red velvet cloth on which
  was embroidered ‘Scotty’, his stage name). He persuaded his sister to take
  part in the ‘sawing a woman in half’ routine, with Olive (at 17) playing
  the part of his ‘beautiful assistant’. The trick may be seen as tame by
  the standard of today’s stage illusionists, but Arnie made the box,
  instructed Olive in her role, and carried the trick through. To her dying day,
  Olive refused to give up the secret of how the trick was accomplished.</font></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><o:p>

  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0cm"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span style="font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">In
  the summer of 1924-25, Olive met Norman Quintrell. <o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;</font></span><font face="Arial" size="3">‘Some
  girlfriends and I were going to stay at the Clifton boarding house at
  Victor,’ she recalled. ‘We got on the train at Adelaide station and found
  a compartment. The train was just pulling out of the station when a young man
  put his head in the compartment and asked if there was a spare seat. He was
  quite attractive; stockily built, with brown wavy hair with flashes of auburn,
  hazel eyes and a lovely smile. He was travelling to Victor for holidays with
  some mates. We found out that his dad was a train driver, he lived at Keswick,
  he worked in a lumberyard, and that he played football for West Adelaide
  Seconds.’</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><font face="Arial" size="3">The
  young men and women kept company through the summer vacation. They were
  photographed together, the men in smart blazers or cream jumpers and slacks,
  the women in calf-length skirts with frills and flounces and broad-brimmed
  hats. Olive reports that, halfway through the holiday, Norman said to her that
  he would have to cut his stay short and return home. When pressed for reasons
  he admitted that he had often been stuck with the bill when the group bought
  lunches and teas and he had run out of cash. She had obviously seen something
  in this young man that was worth investing in so she loaned him two pounds<a title style="mso-footnote-id: ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><span style="mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[4]</span></a>
  so that he could stay for the remainder of the holiday.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span style="font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Photographs
  of them in 1925 at Alberton where Olive now lived, suggest that by then he had
  been introduced to her father. A studio photograph of Norman dated 30 April
  1925 (when he was 23) inscribed simply ‘Yours sincerely, Norman’ suggests
  that the courtship was proceeding steadily, if not with overtly exuberant
  expressions of romance! On October 20<sup>th</sup>, 1928, nearly four years
  after their first meeting, Olive and Norman were married at the Woodville
  Church of England. They honeymooned on the paddle steamer ‘Marion’ on the
  River Murray, and returned to live with Norman’s parents at Hampton Road,
  Keswick.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"><font face="Arial"><span style="font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="3">The
  four-year courtship would not have been uncommon. Norman may have been
  reluctant to give up the freedom of bachelorhood, and Olive would have wanted
  to make sure she had everything newly-weds required. Olive is able to lay
  claim to the fact that she is the first Quintrell bride in at least five
  generations not to be pregnant on her wedding day. Whether this was due to
  good luck, good management or significant self-discipline will never be known!</font></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><o:p>

  <p class="MsoBodyText2"><font face="Arial" size="3">On October 20, 1930
  exactly two years after their wedding, Robert Norman Quintrell was born. The
  birth was a difficult and potentially life-threatening one for mother and
  child, and it appeared likely that he might be the only child of the marriage.
  Fortunately for me, this was not to be the case.</font></p>

  </span></font></span></font><span style="font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font size="3" face="Arial">By
  1931, the world Depression began to have its impact on the new family.
  Norman’s hours were halved and Olive’s brother Cyril and his wife, Lorna,
  moved in with Olive and Norman who were renting their own house in Hampton
  Road, Keswick. Cyril had been laid off and, as a result, was eligible for
  government ration relief, denied to Norman as he was still in part-time
  employment. The newlyweds would have been acutely aware of the suffering of
  ordinary people. They would have known of people who had been forcibly evicted
  from their homes for non-payment of rent, their meagre belongings piled in the
  street. They knew of men who ‘jumped the rattler’, hitching illegal, and
  dangerous, free rides on the underside of trains. As unemployment soared
  towards 30%, there would have been beggars in the streets and men in ragged
  clothes going house to house, vainly pleading for work of any kind. Children
  were mal-nourished and fell ill and school attendances slumped.<o:p>
  </o:p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span style="font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Olive
  became the manager of the household and its finances, a role she never
  relinquished. The support of family became fundamental to survival. Was it in
  these years that the importance of families holding together in times of
  trouble became a defining value for Olive? Could it be that her later
  commitment to family acknowledged by her grandchildren was forged in the
  searing experiences of the Depression years?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

  the mid-1930s, the most severe effects of the Depression were waning, Norman
  was once again in full-time employment, and the couple could begin to look to
  the future with greater optimism. It was the swing era and Olive and Norman
  would have danced to the music of Glen Miller, Benny Goodman and Tommy Dorsey.
  Norman was a competent trombonist and often played in dance bands. In England,
  one king abdicated and another, George VI, was crowned. Norman and Olive
  contemplated the possibility of their own home, and by 1937, plans were under
  way for the purchase of land in the new sub-division of Black Forest. Surgery
  for an ongoing gynaecological problem was discussed and one last pregnancy was
  considered. In September 1937 I was born. Apparently I was a far less
  difficult birth, arriving on time and expeditiously.</font> <font color="#000000">However,
  I was to have no further siblings, as soon after my birth, Olive had a
  hysterectomy. </font><o:p>

  a year of my birth, we had moved into our new home in Byron Road, Black
  Forest. The house was sited near the front of a deep block that reached 120
  metres to the train line at the end of the block. Soon, a garage had been
  erected, a garden and fernery established, almond and fruit trees and
  passionfruit vines planted, and lawns seeded. It was a time for hope after the
  stringencies of the Depression, and for planting for the future. <o:p>

  the storm clouds of war were gathering again. ‘The War to end all Wars’
  had ended less than 20 years before, but the election of Adolph Hitler as
  Chancellor of Germany in January 1933 (and subsequently as president
  (‘Fuhrer’) in 1934) signalled the beginning of new world conflict. Before
  the end of the year Germany and Japan had given notice of withdrawal from the
  fledgling League of Nations<a title style="mso-footnote-id: ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"><span style="mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[6]</span></a>
