          Norman enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force. In 1941, Japanese
          planes bombed Darwin and Broome in Australia&apos;s north; and in early
          1942, Japan took Manila and Singapore. As his uncles in the First

          given his Methodist heritage, he gave his religious denominations as
          &apos;Church of England&apos;, the nominal church of my mother&apos;s.<o:p>

          </span></p>
          <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">Soon
          after enlistment, he was transferred to a training camp at Point Cook
          in Victoria to be trained as a signaller and Olive, Bob and I went to
          Melbourne to stay with my father&apos;s Aunt Topsy – one of Edie&apos;s
          sisters. His records show that he spent some time at the Marconi
          School in Southwest Melbourne, as well as at Laverton and Point Cook.
          In March 1942, he was transferred to &apos;Malvern&apos;. Whether this is
          the suburb of Melbourne or one of the same name in Adelaide is not
          made clear. In May 1942, he was transferred to Victor Harbor. I have
          trace memories of visiting him at a training camp there. I recall Bob
          and some friends climbing pine trees and of wanting to be big enough
          to join them, but also being afraid to climb up. <o:p>
          </o:p>
          </span></p>
          <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">From
          1940 to 1943, Norman had moved steadily through the ranks from
          Corporal to Flight Sergeant. In May 1943 he undertook officer training
          and was appointed to the rank of Flight Lieutenant on 14 August 1943.
          On 28 January 1944, he embarked for New Guinea. Before he left, he dug
          an air-raid trench in our back yard at Byron Rd. I began to hear of
          the need to have blackout curtains in case Adelaide was the target of
          air attacks, and Air Raid Wardens with their tin helmets with ARP
          painted in white appeared.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Newspaper
          cartoons represented Japanese and German soldiers as loathsome,
          subhuman creatures and, to her dying day, Mum maintained an unswerving
          prejudice to anything Asian, derived from this time.<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </span></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">His
          papers show that Norman was posted to Port Moresby, Goodenough Island
          and Nadzab at various stages of his 12 month tour of duty, but they
          give no information on what his experiences might have been. By the
          time of his posting, the Japanese army was in retreat in New Guinea,
          but retained a significant air base in Rabaul on Bougainville Island.
          Goodenough Island, a small island in the D&apos;Esterecaux Group off the
          southeastern end of New Guinea was established as an RAAF air base
          from which the Solomon Island straits could be controlled, and attacks
          on Japanese positions on New Guinea and Rabaul could be launched. The
          squadrons were composed of Boston and Beaufort bombers<a title style="mso-footnote-id: ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span style="mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[1]</span></a>,
          Beaufighters and Kittyhawk fighter planes. The RAAF took control of
          the sea lanes west of the Solomon Islands and along the coast of New
          Britain. Norman&apos;s duties from 1 April to 14 November 1944 are shown
          as &apos;Command&apos; and he was given the rank of Squadron Leader. On this
          latter date, his records show &quot;keep rank&quot;, so I assume he
          completed his duties at that rank. He completed his &apos;tropical
          tour&apos; on 23 February 1945, returned to Australia and was demobilised
          on 19 November 1945.<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </span></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">Why
          would he have volunteered for active service? He didn&apos;t need to –
          he was 39 years old and a married man with children by the time Japan
          entered the war. Certainly Olive didn&apos;t want him to go, and she
          recalls the war years as very difficult and lonely ones.<a title style="mso-footnote-id: ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><span style="mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[2]</span></a>
          Was it a hangover from the stories of his older brother and his dead
          uncles in World War 1? Or were there nobler motives? The desire to
          serve, to do whatever necessary to protect his family, a sense of deep
          patriotism? Perhaps all of these things together.<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </span></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">I
          regret not listening to his stories of the time. I suspect that Mum
          didn&apos;t want to hear any more about the war, and so he was restricted
          to tales of the huge size of the insects, of having learned Pidgin,
          and of the friendliness of &apos;the natives&apos;.<o:p>
          </o:p>

          his service papers is a formal character summary that I read with some
          amusement, as much of its description could apply to my own character.
          The report is dated 17 November 1945, so it has been made just prior
          to his demobilisation. With the exception of the characteristics <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic">dependability&apos;,
          co-operation&apos;</span> and <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic">emotional
          stability&apos;</span> (where the assessor scores him as 4/4), he

          have likened the immediate post-war period in Australia as one in
          which there was an acting out of repressed youth; as if the energy of
          young adulthood in so many men and women had been put on hold and
          could now be acted out. In <i>A gathering of stones</i><a title style="mso-footnote-id: ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><span style="mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[3]</span></a>

            remember my father coming home from the war. I was fourteen, and
            wore my first pair of long trousers with self-conscious pride,
            knowing that I had crossed some important bridge out of childhood to
            join my friends on a road that led to manhood and the revelation of
            mysteries hinted at by adults, but not accessible to children. My
            Uncle Sid had already come home from the war with an empty sleeve
            where his right arm had been. The doctors had been unable to save
            his arm, and he had to learn to be left-handed for the rest of his
            life. Aunt Belle alternated between blaming herself for allowing him
            to go to the war, and blaming Uncle Sid for going. She finally
            settled on the compromise of an unremitting racial prejudice against
            the Japanese people and all things Asian.<o:p>

          </span>I stood on the Adelaide railway station platform with my
          brother and mother, among many other similar family groups waiting for
          the train. It must have been early Spring, as it was not yet my
          birthday, but the day was warm and sunny, and we had seen blossoms out
          as we came into Adelaide to meet the train. My mother wore a
          wide-brimmed white hat and white gloves, and a brown woollen dress
          with a light fleck of white which she had recently made herself. At
          the collar was a brooch of amber stones which my father had given her
          as a birthday gift. As the war had progressed, she had become even
          thinner, and the new dress emphasised the slightness of her figure.
          Alan and I stood apart as we waited. It was obvious that she had
          abandoned us for the moment, and she stood looking down the platform,
          constantly checking and re-checking her gloves, her hat, her brooch,
          her dress. <o:p>
          </o:p>

          </span>A thrill of excitement enlivened the crowd as the train steamed
          into view across the railway yards. The engine was one of the grand
          green and black Mountain types that my Gramp used to drive, and I had
          a sudden flash of loneliness for my dead Nanna, and for my Gramp whom
          I now seldom saw.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
          train rolled slowly into the station, scattering smoke and steam as it
          came under the station roof, and came to a panting halt. Some men had
          leaped down from the train before it had come to a halt and, tossing
          their kits aside, were running down the station in search of their
          families. As soon as the train stopped, the carriages began to
          disgorge their load of khaki- and blue-clad figures. The station was
          suddenly full of crying and of exclamations of delight. Couples were
          embracing and kissing; children were hoisted up in the arms of fathers
          they could hardly remember; one soldier knelt down and kissed the
          platform and burst into tears himself; and in the midst of the tears
          and laughter and steam and excitement, my mother and father were
          embracing and locked in a long kiss. Alan was clinging tightly to my
          hand and standing close against me. <o:p>
          </o:p>
          </span></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          </span>&apos;It'll be OK,&apos; I said. &apos;It's going to be OK. Our Dad's
          home.&apos;<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </span></p>

          </span>He clung even more tightly, looking at our parents with wide
          and apprehensive eyes. Our parents came to us, our mother crying and
          dabbing at her eyes with a handkerchief. It was unusual to see our
          mother cry and if I was discomforted by the sight, Alan must have been
          more so. Our father bent down and greeted Alan with a hug. Alan
          accepted the embrace, but his eyes did not leave our mother's face.<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </span></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          </span>&apos;And look at you. You're a man now,&apos; he said to me. I knew
          that it was the right thing for my father to say, but I did not know
          what the right response was. <o:p>
          </o:p>
          </span></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          </span>&apos;They're both struck dumb,&apos; my father said. &apos;Well,
          there's going to be time now. The war is over and I won't be going
          away again.&apos;<o:p>
          </o:p>

          </span>We began the long walk back along the platform. There were
          also, I noticed, men in wheelchairs being unloaded from the train, and
          the noise around them was more muted. One young couple, oblivious to
          their surroundings, was continuing to kiss and embrace. A lone woman
          stood looking despairingly down the platform as the melee flowed
          around her, a baby in her arms, and a small child crying fractiously
          by her side.<o:p>
          </o:p>

          <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          </span>The domed concourse of the station was echoing with the release
          of six years of tension and anxiety, and the air was vibrant with
          every kind of expression of human pleasure - cries, exclamations,
          chatter, embraces, kisses, whispers, skips, dances, leaps, laughter,
          and shouts. As we came out onto North Terrace, the trees all green
          with new leaves, the happiness of the welcomes spilled out into the
          morning air, and the warmth of the sun and the blue of the sky
          embraced us. There was going to be time now for planting and reaping,
          for conceiving and rearing, for planning and creating, for building
          and crafting, for singing and dancing.<o:p>
