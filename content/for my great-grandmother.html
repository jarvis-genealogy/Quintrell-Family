  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">It
  was a clear, late autumn day, the sun warm enough to shed the coats we had
  worn out of respect for the occasion. A haze of smoke from the smouldering
  stubble on the farms lay low on the horizon and faint smell of burning hung in
  the air. The conversation from the crowd gathering at the cemetery gates was
  muted, broken occasionally by a chatter of welcome as people identified
  friends and relatives not seen since the last Kerneweek Lowender. The
  neatly-lettered sign on the cemetery gatepost had been freshly re-painted,
  sharply black against the whitewash of the post: &apos;Victoria Regina AD 1862.
  No 19. Act for the Regulation of Cemeteries. The Town of Moonta.&apos; My
  great-grandfather Stephen had re-surveyed the cemetery in the 1890s. The
  cemetery, still in use, has been declared a National Trust heritage.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">I
  found my cousins Brian and Glen in the crowd and we greeted each other warmly
  as if we had known each other a lifetime. In fact, we had only met since the
  Festival two years ago. There was an excited babble of greetings as I was
  introduced to Brian&apos;s sisters, seven other descendants of Mary Ann Quintrell
  (nee Datson). Despite our common ancestry, we had never met. We were gathered
  with others with similar purpose, to honour our ancestors. For us, it was in
  memory of our great-grandmother, who had lived almost her entire life at
  Moonta Mines. She had arrived at Port Adelaide on the &apos;General Hewett&apos;
  when she was only three years old and, after a brief period at Burra, had
  moved with her parents to Moonta Mines. In 1865, she had married Stephen
  Quintrell with whom she had thirteen children. She died in 1934 at the age of
  89.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">As
  1.30 pm approached, the crowd had swelled to about a hundred. Some were
  dressed in period costume: the women in long black skirts, knitted shawls over
  white blouses and jenny caps or straw hats decorated with flowers; and the men
  black-suited, with waistcoat and cloth cap or top hat; and the children in
  long, floral-patterned skirts with matching caps and black boots. Two children
  amused themselves walking along a line of limestone that marked the edge of
  the paths, teetering as if on a tightrope.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Two
  peals of the bell forged from copper that had been the core of the area&apos;s
  economy from the mid-nineteenth to the early-twentieth centuries stilled the
  chatter of the crowd which parted to allow the symbolic funeral procession to
  approach the cemetery gates. A pony pulling a small trap bearing the floral
  tributes led the procession. The &apos;undertaker&apos; led the way, resplendent in
  top hat and tails, accompanied by the &apos;parson&apos; in black gown.
  &apos;Pall-bearers&apos; in waistcoat and caps carried a mock coffin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Children and adults in traditional dress completed the procession. A
  single violin played a hymn that reminded us of a simple faith – &apos;Jesus
  loves me, this I know, for the Bible tells me so.&apos;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">The
  procession paused at the gates as a statement of the meaning of the ceremony
  was read. With a creak of its hinges, the gates opened and the crowd flowed
  into the cemetery behind the formal procession. We paused at the site of the
  children&apos;s graves, our throats tightening with emotion as we recalled how
  hundreds had died in epidemics in the 1870s and 1880s, from diphtheria,
  whooping cough, typhoid, dysentery and scarlet fever, often courtesy of the
  drinking water which was collected in underground tanks and contaminated with
  polluted surface run-off. A quartet sang the soulful &apos;Abide with me, fast
  falls the even-tide&apos;, and the sadly longing &apos;I love the white rose in its
  splendour&apos;.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">We
  moved slowly to each of the allotted grave stations, hearing of the courage
  and stoicism of the pioneers of the district: mine captains and miners; the
  illiterate and the teachers; wives dying young in childbirth and husbands
  injured in mine explosions; and of those who endured grief and hardship. Then
  it was our turn. Brian and I stood at the edge of our great-grandmother&apos;s
  grave as her citation was read. <o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">&apos;…
    thirteen children … three died in infancy and a fourth in adolescence …
    widowed in 1913, so bearing alone the grief of the death of three sons in
    the Great War … her brother Hugh dead in a mining accident<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>…&apos; <o:p>
    </o:p>
    </span></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Brian
  and I bent and placed the wreath on the grave and stood in silence. I waited
  for some swell of feeling to rise, but there was only a sense of quiet
  reverence. I pondered on the difference between the life she lived and the one
  I enjoyed, and acknowledged the debt I owed to her fortitude and endurance.
  Somewhere in me, the same ability to endure must exist, but it has not been
  put to the test as it was for her. <o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  The procession moved on to the next station and I gathered with my
  newly-discovered relatives and their wives and husbands for family
  photographs. Released from the solemnity of the occasion, we broke into
  laughter and excited chatter and had to be shushed into silence as the formal
  proceedings at other gravesites were still in process.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Dispersing, we
  wandered in the cemetery, noting the names of other ancestors. I had relocated
  my mother&apos;s and father&apos;s grave markers to the niche wall at Moonta and I
  mused on the continuity of existence. A hundred and seventy years ago, no
  European would have stood here and the local indigenous people would have
  occupied this place undisturbed for centuries. The arrival of Europeans at
  Glenelg in 1836 would have gone unmarked by them but when, less than twenty
  years later, someone recognised the green tinge of copper in the rocks of the
  area, their lives were changed forever. The hunger for the world for the metal
  brought people flocking to the Copper Triangle, and our ancestors in Cornwall
  decided that the risks of sea travel and starting a new life from scratch were
  worth chancing. <o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  We stood in the afternoon sunshine, suddenly aware of the blood and bone that
  connects us as we paid tribute to the courage of our ancestors that has gifted
  to us riches they could not have imagined, and which we – sometimes
  unthinkingly, sometimes with wondering gratitude&mdash;accept as our due. And on
  this quiet autumn day, we acknowledged our great-grandmother, her courage, her
  strength and her gifts to us.<o:p>
