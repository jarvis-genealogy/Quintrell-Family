  Eighties began with a volcanic eruption on Mt St Helens and ended with an
  earthquake in San Francisco. These signs in the earth were reflections of the
  upheavals in the world’s political and social maps. In Poland, workers at
  Gdansk went on strike, demanding the right to join unions not under Communist
  control. By the end of the decade, the Berlin Wall was torn down, the
  Brandenburg Gate opened, Communist rule in many Eastern European countries
  overthrown, and Communism in the USSR was near its end. New words and threats
  were introduced into the language and their ideas would dominate world
  discussions for the remainder of Olive’s lifetime. The AIDS virus was
  identified. The hole in the ozone layer and the threat of global warming
  fuelled debates about the future of industrialisation and the need to attend
  to matters of conservation of the world’s resources. In Adelaide in the
  early Eighties, bushfires twice ravaged the Adelaide hills and country areas
  with loss of life and property.<o:p>

  </span>In Vancouver, the painful task of mending broken relationships was
  proceeding. After an early stumble, Bob regained sobriety. He formed a
  relationship with Betty Brannan that enriched his life; found productive work
  at the University of British Columbia’s Biomedical Communications Unit; and
  began to explore reconciliation with his children. This latter task was not
  easy and, if it had not been for Olive’s trail-blazing visit and constant
  commitment, may not have been accomplished at all.<o:p>

  </span>The photograph shows Olive, Bob, Stacey and Kirstie at Montague Harbour
  on Galiano Island during a visit from Olive in 1982. As ever, her hair is
  permed and she is impeccably attired in a sensible pantsuit. Here are
  representatives of the four generations of her family. Bob has found peace
  with himself and his family. His relationship with Betty Brannan has bought
  stability and love back into his life and the quiet beauty of the Gulf Islands
  has restored his spirit. Olive walks at a slight distance from the family
  group. Perhaps, at some level, she knows that her task of bringing the family
  together is now complete and that the future belongs to the next generations.
  By 1983, matters were firm enough to make a visit from Charmian, Frai (and her
  then boyfriend, Russell), Ricki and me a happy and exciting event, and paved
  the way for many subsequent travels to Canada for Charmian and me.<o:p>

  remaining years of the decade were, however, to bring sadnesses to Olive. Both

  Bob’s visit in 1985, cancer cells had been discovered in his throat, cancer
  which would within four years end his life. <o:p>

  there were also significant satisfactions for Olive. With the birth of Kirstie
  Leigh, in 1980, and Fergus, in 1982, she became a great-grandmother. This was
  followed by Carys Charmian in 1984, Aaron Leonard in 1985, Dylan Neil in 1986,
  Andrew Mark in 1987, and Alicia Lorene, in 1988. Within the space of eight
  years, Olive was a great-grandmother seven times over<a title style="mso-footnote-id: ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span style="mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[1]</span></a>.
  She was always at birthdays and Christmas celebrations and we continue the
  tradition she began of providing the chickens for Christmas dinner. She took a
  lively interest in her grandchildren. In preparing this tribute, I listened to
  a tape she and I had prepared as I interviewed her about some of the incidents
  that are reported under her childhood. Ricki would have been aged about 3 at
  the time and, from time to time, interrupts Olive’s narrative to ask a
  question. Olive handles the interruption calmly, turning her attention from
  the story to satisfy Ricki’s needs without irritation. A later memory of
  Ricki’s is being made to be quiet while Olive watched ‘Days of our
  Lives’ on TV! One of my favourite photos of this period shows Ricki and
  Olive examining shells that Ricki had collected at Silver Sands.<o:p>

  unselfconsciously tried her hand at a new painting technique at which, Victor

  further trips to Canada in 1985 and 1987. As she farewelled Bob and Betty on
  the second visit, she could not know that she would not see Bob again. In
  January 1988, while I was at a conference in New Zealand, I received the
  fateful news that Bob’s cancer had now metastasised and that he had only a
  matter of months to live. I record my visit to Vancouver in February 1988 and

  sat for a long time in front of the phone, persuading myself that I was
  waiting to be sure my mother was awake. I fussily rang the operator to check
  that I had the time difference precisely right. I saw her small figure, still
  spritely in her eighties, busying herself with breakfast. The morning sun
  would have broken clear of the low screen of trees across the creek and would
  be shining on the East window of her lounge room, the curtains already drawn
  against the heat. She would have risen early, as was her custom in the summer,
  watered her pot plants and ferns, and fed the tame ducks that lived in the
  creek. I imagined her bending over and scattering the pieces of bread she had
  saved and soaked for them the night before, clucking and talking to them as
  familiar pets. If she had seen the stray cats that also frequented the creek,
  she would have sprayed the hose at them and shooed them away. By now she would
  have made her toast and tea, and settled down in her chair to do battle with
  the crossword from the daily newspaper. A widow now for over fifteen years,
  she had become a self-sufficient person, able to both enjoy her own company
  and embrace the company of others with delight. She laughed easily and
  maintained a remarkably positive attitude to life despite widowhood,
  arthritis, and declining mobility and eyesight. Never a large woman, she had
  become increasingly diminutive with the passing years as her arthritis ground
  down her hips and spine. The family joke went that Grannie Q. would never die,
  she would become smaller and smaller and just disappear, leaving her sparkling
  laughter echoing around the room.<o:p>

  </span>She had always been the central fact of my life. My early asthma had
  made me dependent on her. In the absence of my father, I had striven to please
  her, unconsciously aware that my very life may depend on her and that I could
  not afford to lose her. My father’s absences at the war meant that he had
  been a shadowy existence for me until I was eight or nine. Bob had departed
  overseas when I was fourteen, and our father had died over fifteen years ago.
  But our mother had always been there. It was she who remembered every birthday
  of every family member. It was she who maintained the correspondence, and from
  whom all the postcards came when she and our father had travelled overseas. It
  was she who provided the useful and thoughtful household gifts during the
  first few years of Charmian’s and my marriage when money was tight and we
  were establishing a home. <o:p>

  was a private matter to Olive. I had remained in almost daily phone contact
  while I was in Vancouver, and we had spoken freely about what was happening
  and our feelings. I had tape recordings of Bob’s funeral service made and
  brought her photographs taken of the people who had attended. When I returned
  to Adelaide, I gave her the tape and photos. She put them aside. <o:p>

  </span>‘I’ll listen to that later,’ she said, typically delaying dealing
  with a difficult issue until a time and place of her own choosing. She told me
  later that she spent all one afternoon listening to the tape several times and
  poring over the photos. I imagine that she wept as she grieved for her dead
  son and for the lost opportunities. I hope that she also wept in gladness for
  the reconciliation he had achieved with his children, and for her contribution
  to it. By the end of the Eighties, Olive was about to turn 85 and the signs of
  significant aging were beginning to appear. With the reappearance of
  Halley’s Comet in 1990, I wonder if she recognised that the circle of her
  own life was beginning to close.<o:p>

  <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">By
  the early 1990s, Olive was beginning to struggle with health problems that
  largely kept her housebound. In typical fashion, she began to arrange her life
  to accommodate her limitations. Charmian’s parents took her shopping for her
  weekly needs. The family doctor continued to call on her regularly and the
  pharmacy delivered her medicines. ‘Meals on Wheels’ provided her weekday
  food needs and she squirreled away left overs to get her through the weekend
  on the occasions when we were unable to provide for her. She accepted the
  suggestion of employing a house-cleaner, and persuaded the bank across the
  road to bring her cash each fortnight when her pension was deposited. I had
  taken over her financial affairs and we regularly took her and Marge Milkins
  out for drives on weekends. There were deaths of significant others in this
  period. Her sisters Lily and Alice, her aunts Maudie and May Dickson<a title style="mso-footnote-id: ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><span style="mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[3]</span></a>,
  and her half-brother Jack<a title style="mso-footnote-id: ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><span style="mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[4]</span></a>
  all died, leaving Olive the last surviving member of her immediate family.<o:p>

  </span>By 1992, it was obvious that it was becoming difficult for her to
  remain in her own home. We began a weekly charade in which she would phone me
  on Friday – before my regular Saturday morning visit – and say that she
  had lost her purse. We would spend an hour or more looking under, over and in
  things before her purse came to light – never hidden in the same place
  twice!<a title style="mso-footnote-id: ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"><span style="mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[5]</span></a>
  Once she nearly set fire to her unit when using a faulty firelighter and, on
  another occasion, fell and struck her head badly, having to call to the
  next-door neighbour for help.<o:p>

  </span>I put in train the necessary steps to have her move into a hostel unit
  in an aged care home at Belair, only a couple of kilometres from our home. In
  July 1993, she moved from her own home at Hawthorn into the Kalyra Aged Care
  Facility. Although she accepted the change with reasonable grace, it was some
  time before she stopped saying, ‘I don’t know why I came here. I used to
  be able to …’, and she would string off a list of things she could do from
  Hawthorn – catch the bus, go around to the shops, go across to the bank –
  none of which she had been able to do for some years. It was soon apparent
  that her short-term memory was becoming significantly compromised. She could
  still bluff her way through a conversation and make a quick quip, but she
  started to forget the names of her grandchildren, and to be confused about
  relationships. On March 8<sup>th</sup>, 1995, we celebrated Olive’s 90<sup>th</sup>
  birthday with a few relatives and friends and I made the short speech that I
  referred to her in her funeral eulogy. <o:p>

  <p class="MsoBodyText" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">In
  1996, she was admitted to hospital with what was diagnosed as a perforated
  bowel. I sat with her at Flinders Medical Centre and talked through the
  meaning of this with her. She was faced with the ‘devil’s alternative’
  – without surgery this condition was fatal, but she was unlikely to survive
  major surgery at her age. She understood and accepted this reality
  philosophically. ‘I’ve had a good life,’ she said, ‘and we all have to
  go sometime.’<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I told her how
  much we loved and admired her, thanked her for being the mother and
  grandmother she had been, and reminded her of her contribution to the Canadian
  family. I kissed her tenderly and left. The next day, Charmian, Chalien,
  Lorene, Frai, Ricki and I stood at the end of her hospital bed looking at the
  small figure sleeping in the hospital bed. We cried, said our farewells, and
  told her unconscious figure what a wonderful mother and Grannie she had been.<o:p>

  </span>However, Olive was not finished yet! The ‘perforated bowel’ was
  actually a bleeding ulcer, and two days later she was sitting up eating
  breakfast! She lived another year, although clearly in declining health and
  increasing confusion. We celebrated Christmas 1996 in the private dining room
  at Kalyra, and she was able to make a joke and join in the fun of having her
  Australian family around her.<o:p>

  At dinner, I told my daughters that Olive would not last the night. We
  regularly had family jokes about the ‘meaning of life’ (which I held to be
  represented in baseball!) and I said something to them like, ‘The most
  important thing in life for me is the relationships we make and hold
  throughout our lives.’ This, of course, I had learned from my mother’s
  steadfast commitment to family, her ability to nurture relationships, and her
  capacity for fun. The next day, without fuss or fanfare, Olive died. At her
  wish, her ashes are scattered with those of my father, in the rose garden at
  Centennial Park and, somewhere in an Adelaide park, a tree has been planted in
  her memory.<o:p>
